<p class='fs14 center'>BOBBY BLAKE ON A PLANTATION</p>
<h2 class='nobreak'>CHAPTER I<br/>THE SINKING BOAT</h2>

<p class='first'>“I tell you what, fellows, that was some game
yesterday,” said Fred Martin, as he sat with his
comrades on the steps of Rockledge Hall, the day
after that memorable Thanksgiving Day when
Rockledge had beaten its great rival, Belden, in
the annual football game.</p>

<p>“It was a close shave though,” remarked his
chum, Bobby Blake, who had been the chief factor
in the victory. “There were only two minutes
left of playing time when, we got the touchdown.
It came just in the nick of time.”</p>

<p>“I thought you were a goner when that fellow
Hoskins dove at you,” put in Jimmy Ailshine,
better known as “Shiner.” “That fellow sure
is a terror when it comes to tackling. He grabs
you as if you were a long-lost brother.”</p>

<p>“He came mighty near stopping me,” admitted
Bobby. “I just felt his fingers touch me as
I dodged. But a miss is as good as a mile, in
football as in everything else.”</p>

<p>“It was a tough game for Belden to lose,”
commented Perry Wise, a big, fat boy, who went
by the ironical nickname of “Pee Wee.” “But
both teams couldn’t win, and we were just a little
bit too good for them,” he added complacently.</p>

<p>“Listen to that ‘we’,” jibed “Sparrow” Bangs.
“Lot you had to do with it, you old elephant.”</p>

<p>“Wasn’t I sitting there rooting to beat the
band?” demanded Pee Wee in an aggrieved tone.
“And let me tell you I’m some little rooter.”</p>

<p>“Well, we’ve won the banner of blue and gold
anyway,” declared Howell Purdy. “Maybe it
won’t look good floating from the top of that
flagstaff.”</p>

<p>“I wonder when we’re going to get it,” pondered
“Skeets” Brody. “Have you seen it yet,
Bobby?”</p>

<p>“Not yet,” replied Bobby. “But Frank Durrock
told me all about it. It’s mighty nifty. It’s
made in blue and gold, with a football in the center.
Then at each of the four corners there’ll
be the emblem of one of the schools that played
for it, and it will have embroidered on it: ‘Champions
of the Monatook Lake Football League.’”</p>

<p>“I’d like to have the letters big enough so that
the Belden fellows could read it from across the
lake,” chuckled Sparrow.</p>

<p>“Come off, Sparrow,” said Bobby with a
laugh. “You’re like the Indians who scalp the
dead. It ought to be enough for you that we
beat them, without wanting to rub it in. Besides,
we didn’t beat them by such a margin that we
can afford to brag much about it. They sure let
us know that we’d been in a fight.”</p>

<p>“Talking of fighting,” chimed in Billy Bassett,
“did any of you fellows hear of the hold up
that took place in town this morning?”</p>

<p>“Hold up!” came in a chorus from the lips of
all the boys, as they crowded around him.</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Billy, “up at Mr. Henderson’s
house, about nine o’clock.”</p>

<p>“In broad daylight!” ejaculated Fred. “Gee,
but those robbers are getting bold. Are you sure
about it, Billy?”</p>

<p>“Dead sure,” replied Billy. “In fact, I just
happened to be passing by, and I saw the whole
thing.”</p>

<p>“You saw it!” cried Sparrow, fairly bubbling
over with excitement. “It’s a wonder you didn’t
say something before. How many were there in
it?”</p>

<p>“There were two against one,” answered
Billy.</p>

<p>“Weren’t you awfully scared?” asked Skeets.</p>

<p>“Not a bit,” declared Billy. “Why should I
be scared at seeing two clothes pins holding up a
shirt?”</p>

<p>There was a moment of awful silence.</p>

<p>Then with a howl the crowd rose and threw
themselves on Billy, and mauled and pounded him
until he begged for mercy.</p>

<p>“To think that I fell for it!” snorted Fred disgustedly.
“I sure am easy.”</p>

<p>“I’m just as bad,” mourned Sparrow. “I
swallowed the whole thing, hook, line and sinker.
I’m not fit to go around alone. They ought to
put me in an asylum for the feeble-minded.”</p>

<p>“Serves you both right,” laughed Bobby.
“You ought to know Billy by this time. Whenever
he starts to talk you can be sure that he’s
trying to put something over on us.”</p>

<p>“I’d hate to have your suspicious disposition,”
grinned Billy, highly delighted with the success
he had scored.</p>

<p>“Say, fellows, isn’t it getting near time for
lunch?” spoke up Pee Wee from his recumbent
position on one of the steps.</p>

<p>“Can’t that tank ever get filled up?” asked
Skeets. “Look at the way he polished off that
grand old Thanksgiving dinner, and he’s starving
yet.”</p>

<p>“That was yesterday,” explained Pee Wee.
“How long do you think one dinner’s going to
last? Don’t you suppose I’ve got to keep up my
strength?”</p>

<p>“What for?” scoffed Skeets. “You’re too
lazy to use it anyway.”</p>

<p>“Don’t forget that he’s got a lot of weight to
carry around,” admonished Fred.</p>

<p>“What seems to be the matter down there,”
put in Sparrow, pointing to a tree on the campus
about a hundred feet from where the boys were
lounging.</p>

<p>The others followed the direction of Sparrow’s
finger and saw two boys engaged in what seemed
to be an angry dispute. Even as they looked, the
larger of the two snatched off the cap of his companion
and threw it on the ground.</p>

<p>“Bill Snath is at it again!” exclaimed Fred,
jumping to his feet. “He’s ragging that new
pupil that came in a few days ago, Cartier I think
his name is.”</p>

<p>“Might know that Snath couldn’t stay decent
for long,” remarked Skeets. “He toned down
a little after Sandy Jackson skipped out, but now
he’s up to his old tricks. Cartier’s a good deal
smaller than he is.”</p>

<p>“That’s the reason Snath’s picking on him,”
said Bobby. “Trust that bully not to tackle anyone
of his own size. Come along, fellows, and
let’s see what the trouble’s about.”</p>

<p>They hurried in the direction of the two disputants,
even Pee Wee showing more speed than
usual, although even at that he brought up in the
rear.</p>

<p>In the meantime, Snath had added insult to injury
by planting his feet firmly on Cartier’s cap
and looking on with a malicious grin on his face,
while his victim tugged at it in vain attempts to
regain it.</p>

<p>As the running boys neared the two, Snath
caught sight of them, and a look of disappointment,
not unmixed with fear, came into his small,
pale eyes. For a moment he appeared as though
about to slink away, but he thought better of it
and stood his ground.</p>

<p>“What’s going on?” asked Bobby, as his eyes
went from one to the other.</p>

<p>“Don’t know that that’s any of your business,”
growled Snath, a pasty-faced, loose-jawed youth,
with mean eyes set too close together.</p>

<p>“We’ll make it our business, you big bully,”
Fred was beginning, when Bobby placed a restraining
hand on his chum’s arm.</p>

<p>“Just a minute, Fred,” he said. “Let’s hear
what Cartier has to say about it,” he went on,
turning to the other boy. “How about it, Lee?”</p>

<p>“I was passing by him when he told me to take
off my cap to him,” replied Lee Cartier, a slender,
dark-eyed boy with a clean-cut, intelligent
face. “I told him I wouldn’t and then he
grabbed it and threw it on the ground. He’s
standing on it now,” and he pointed to the
crumpled cap under the bully’s feet.</p>

<p>“Suppose you let Lee have his cap, Snath,”
said Bobby.</p>

<p>“Suppose I don’t,” snarled the bully doggedly.</p>

<p>“Then we’ll make you,” Fred burst out hotly,
his face almost as red as the fiery hair combined
with a fiery temper that had gained for him the
nickname of “Ginger.”</p>

<p>But again Bobby intervened.</p>

<p>“Easy, Fred,” he counseled. “Now look here,
Snath,” he continued, fixing his eyes steadily on
the bully, who tried to meet his gaze, though his
shifty eyes wavered, “we’ve had enough of this
sort of thing in this school, and we’re not going
to stand for any more of it. Sandy Jackson
tried it and couldn’t get away with it, and you’re
not going to, either. Take your foot off that
cap.”</p>

<p>“I won’t!” snapped Snath furiously, though
there was a perceptible wobbly movement of his
knees. “Who do you think you are anyway,
Bobby Blake? You just quit butting in and let
me tend to my own affairs. You needn’t think
you’re running this school.”</p>

<p>“Take your foot off that cap,” repeated Bobby,
not raising his voice a particle, but moving a step
forward so that he was within easy reach.</p>

<p>The rest of the boys crowded about the two, all
agog with expectation of a “scrap.” There was
not one of them but cordially detested the bully,
and many of them had been the victims of his
petty torments. They were eager to see him get
the thrashing he richly deserved, and that they
felt Bobby was fully able to give him.</p>

<p>But Snath was one of those who believed that
discretion was the better part of valor. He hated
to give in, with all the boys looking at him, but he
hated still worse the idea of coming to blows with
Bobby, although he was much the larger of the
two. His eyes fell on Bobby’s fists which were
slowly clenching, and then with a growl he stepped
back off the cap. He could not resist, however,
the temptation to give the head covering a
vicious kick.</p>

<p>“Take your old cap,” he snarled. “As for
you, Bobby Blake, I’ll get even with you for this
when you haven’t got your crowd with you.”</p>

<p>“Make him pick it up, Bobby!” shouted Fred,
who was disappointed at not seeing the bully get
his just deserts.</p>

<p>But Lee had already picked up the cap and
put it on his head, while he flashed a look of gratitude
at his champion.</p>

<p>Snath shambled away with a last malignant
look at Bobby that was full of threats of vengeance
in the future.</p>

<p>“It’s too bad you didn’t have an excuse for
trimming him, Bobby,” sighed Sparrow, as the
bully’s form vanished round a comer of the
building. “He’s had a licking coming to him for
a long time, and you’re the one who could have
done him up to the queen’s taste.”</p>

<p>“I don’t want to fight,” replied Bobby. “I
never want to if I can help it. You know the
trouble that came from that mixup with Sandy
Jackson. But there’s been too much of this bullying
going on in the school and it’s just as well
to let fellows like Snath know where they get
off.”</p>

<p>“He’s got it in for you,” declared Skeets.
“Did you see that look he gave you when he went
away? I’ll bet he’s figuring out right now some
dirty trick to play on you.”</p>

<p>“Let him figure,” laughed Bobby. “I should
worry a lot and build a house on it. But what
do you say, fellows, to kicking the football around
a little? I’m a little sore from yesterday, and it
will help get some of the kinks out of my bones.
Besides it will help us get up an appetite for
lunch.”</p>

<p>All assented readily, except Pee Wee.</p>

<p>“I’ve got all the appetite I want already,” he
said. “If I had any more I’d be starving to
death. But you dubs go ahead and play, and I’ll
lie down here and rest.”</p>

<p>“That’s the best thing you do,” chaffed Fred.</p>

<p>“Rest is Pee Wee’s middle name,” jibed Sparrow.</p>

<p>But the good-natured fat boy only smiled in a
superior sort of way and made himself comfortable,
while his comrades got the ball and put it in
action. There were not enough of them to form
two elevens and play a regular game, but they
got up a couple of skeleton teams and were soon
in the thick of some lively scrimmages.</p>

<p>The new boy, Lee Cartier, had been chosen by
Bobby as one of his side, and although he was
not familiar with the fine points of the game, he
played with zest and spirit and showed that he
had it in him to become a good player. What he
lacked in weight and strength he made up in quickness,
and he followed the ball in a way that called
forth praise from Bobby.</p>

<p>“That was good work, Lee,” the latter said,
after Lee had fallen like a flash on the ball that
one of the opposing players had fumbled.</p>

<p>Lee’s face flushed with pleasure at the commendation.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid I’m a good deal of a dub at the
game,” he answered. “If I could ever learn to
play the way you did yesterday it would be something
to talk about. I wish you would teach me
the way the game ought to be played. Will you?”</p>

<p>“I’ve got lots to learn about it myself,” replied
Bobby, “but what little I know you’re welcome
to. There’ll probably be lots of days when
we can practice before real cold weather comes.”</p>

<p>Just then a cry of alarm arose from Fred, as
he happened to glance toward the lake.</p>

<p>“Look at that boat!” he shouted. “It looks
as if it were sinking!”</p>

<p>All eyes were turned on a boat containing four
boys, about a quarter of a mile from the shore.
Two of the occupants were pulling desperately at
the oars, but making scarcely any progress. The
other inmates of the boat were waving their hands
wildly and shouting at the tops of their voices,
although what they were saying could not be distinguished
at that distance.</p>

<p>Bobby gave one look and threw down the football.</p>

<p>“Come along, fellows!” he shouted, as he made
for the boathouse at the top of his speed.</p>

<p>“They’re sinking and we’ve got to save them!”</p>

</div>

<div id='chII' class='chapter'>
<h2>CHAPTER II<br/>JUST IN TIME</h2>

<p class='first'>There was a wild shout as the other boys followed,
and they were close on Bobby’s heels when
he reached the boathouse.</p>

<p>There were several boats in the house, most of
them laid up in canvas coverings, as the weather
was becoming so cold that the lake offered no
special attraction. One boat, however, and
luckily the one nearest the doors, was available,
and to this Bobby rushed.</p>

<p>“Lend a hand, some of you fellows!” he called.
“Some one get two pairs of oars from the rack.
Hurry now! We can’t waste a second.”</p>

<p>In a moment the oars were handed down and
put in the boat and Bobby had thrown open the
sliding doors.</p>

<p>Willing hands helped him to push the boat down
the slanting way that led to the float.</p>

<p>“Four of us can go in this,” cried Bobby.
“You, Fred, and you, Sparrow, and—”</p>

<p>“Let me go,” begged Lee, whose eyes were
burning with excitement. “I’ve had a good deal
of practice in rowing and I can handle an oar as
well as any one.”</p>

<p>“All right,” agreed Bobby. “Into the water
now with the boat.”</p>

<p>The rowboat was shoved into the water and
held to the float by Skeets and Shiner, while
Bobby and his three mates tumbled in, grasped
the oars and pulled off.</p>

<p>By this time it was plainly to be seen that the
endangered boat was much lower in the water
than it was when it had first been seen. The
gunwales were almost flush with the level of the
lake, and the two who had been rowing had abandoned
the oars, as it was impossible to drag the
heavily laden water-logged boat through the
water. The occupants had thrown off their coats,
and two of them were tugging away at their
shoes, preparatory to the swim for life that
seemed inevitable.</p>

<p>The boys who were left on the shore waved
their hands frantically, shouting to the boys in
the sinking boat not to jump, and pointing to the
other boat that was coming to their assistance.</p>

<p>In the meantime, Bobby and his companions
were bending to the oars lustily and putting all
their strength into every stroke.</p>

<p>“Keep at it, fellows!” panted Bobby, while
the perspiration rolled down his face. “Don’t
stop to look behind. I’ll take a look once in a
while just so as to keep the boat steering right.
Pull with all your might!”</p>

<p>His comrades needed no urging, and the boat
leaped through the water with a speed that rapidly
cut down the space that still intervened between
it and the sinking craft.</p>

<p>For sinking it was now beyond a doubt. The
occupants had for the moment abandoned the design
of springing overboard, and were baling
frantically, using their caps and sweaters and
hands in the effort to keep the doomed boat afloat
until their rescuers could reach them.</p>

<p>“If they can only keep afloat two minutes
more!” gasped Bobby, as a glance behind showed
him the awful danger. “Don’t spare yourself,
fellows. It may mean life or death. Just two
minutes more and we’ll get them.”</p>

<p>But the two minutes grace could not be granted.
They had got within perhaps a hundred feet,
when there was a desperate cry from the inmates
of the sinking boat, which was echoed from the
watching crowd on the shore. The next instant
the boat went down by the bow, and its four occupants
were struggling in the lake.</p>

<p>“Pull, fellows, pull!” Bobby fairly screamed,
bending almost double with his own exertions.</p>

<p>And while the other rescuers were following
his example, it may be well for the benefit of
those who have not read the earlier volumes of
this series, to trace briefly his adventures and
those of his friends up to the time this story
opens.</p>

<p>Bobby Blake was a bright, wide-awake American
boy, who had been brought up in the small
but prosperous inland village of Clinton. He
was the only son of parents who were in comfortable
circumstances. Bobby was frank,
merry and straightforward, and a great favorite
with the boys of his own age, of whom he was the
natural leader.</p>

<p>Bobby’s special chum was Fred Martin, son of
a Clinton business man, who lived only a few
doors away from the Blakes. Fred was freckled,
redhaired, and had the hot impulsive temper that
often goes with that color of hair. But he was
good and generous of heart, and he and Bobby
got on famously together. Fred was constantly
getting into trouble of one kind or another, and
Bobby was kept busy trying to prevent his friend
from reaping the consequences of his quick temper.
Bobby never looked for trouble, though he
was always ready to defend his rights and would
not let himself be imposed on. The boys were
inseparable, and wherever one was found the
other was pretty sure not to be far away.</p>

<p>When Bobby was ten years old, Mr. Blake was
suddenly called away on business to South
America, and as Mrs. Blake was going with him,
it became necessary to send the lad away to
boarding school. Bobby and Fred were feeling
very badly over the prospect of their being separated,
when, to the delight of both, their parents
decided to send them to Rockledge School together.
The school was a fine one, located on a
beautiful sheet of water called Monatook Lake.
Here the chums found that they had to study
hard, but they also had lots of fun and adventure.
Some bullies tried to tyrannize over them,
but failed in the attempt, and how Bobby came
out ahead of them is told in the first volume of
the series, entitled: “Bobby Blake at Rockledge
School.”</p>

<p>Vacation time found Bobby spending a few
weeks at the summer home of Perry Wise, or
“Pee Wee,” the big, fat boy whose laziness and
enormous appetite were a source of good-natured
fun for all the Rockledge boys. Here they had a
great variety of sports, for the home was on the
sea coast and there were abundant opportunities
for swimming, boating and fishing. The hunt
for a missing motor boat added greatly to the
excitement of their visit.</p>

<p>Their stay was cut short by a message from
Bobby’s parents to meet them at Porto Rico,
where they expected to stop on their homeward
journey. Bobby was wild to meet them, the
more so because at one time their ship had been
reported as shipwrecked and lost. It was arranged
that Fred should go with him, and the
boys embarked in high spirits. Their ship caught
fire, however, and they with others found themselves
adrift, landing at last on a volcanic island,
narrowly escaping with their lives.</p>

<p>“The fellows at Rockledge will hardly believe
us when we tell them all we’ve gone through,” declared
Bobby, as they were on their way home.</p>

<p>“It will sound as if we were stretching things,”
admitted Fred, “but I guess they’ll believe us
when we cross our hearts. Anyway, we know it’s
true.”</p>

<p>They found the Fall term at Rockledge full of
sport and interest and they had some surprising
experiences. Many of these were due to the
warm rivalry that existed between Rockledge
and Belden School, a rival institution on the further
side of Monatook Lake.</p>

<p>When the Christmas holidays came, Bobby and
a number of his special chums were invited to
visit Snowtop Camp belonging to an uncle of
“Mouser” Pryde. This was up in the Big
Woods. There were wildcats near there, to say
nothing of a big bear that made lots of trouble
for them before the boys got the best of him.
There was a snowslide too that buried their house
and gave them some lively work to dig themselves
out.</p>

<p>With the coming of Spring, the boys of Rockledge
were alive with enthusiasm over baseball.
Bobby and Fred became members of the Rockledge
nine, and it was Bobby’s fine work as a
pitcher in the most important games that enabled
the Rockledge boys to beat Belden out and
win the baseball championship of the school
league.</p>

<p>“I tell you what, he just had the Belden fellows
eating out of his hand,” was the way Jimmy
Ailshine, or “Shiner,” as he was called, expressed
his opinion of Bobby’s work in the box.</p>

<p>An entirely new experience came to Bobby
when he and Fred and several of their schoolboy
friends went out West to a ranch owned by a
relative of Sparrow Bangs. Here they made
friends with the cowboys and learned to ride, and
they also fell in with a moving picture company
and took part in the making of a film. The way
they discovered the plot of some Mexicans and
lawless characters and were able to thwart it
forms the subject of a very exciting story.</p>

<p>There was still a part of their vacation left,
when they returned from the ranch, and Skeets
Brody urged them to spend this in making a trip
in his father’s automobile. A copperhead snake
that took possession of their cave furnished an
exciting feature of the trip, which was further
enlivened by an encounter with gypsies. They
rescued two little children from these vagabonds
of the road, though at considerable risk to themselves,
and had the good fortune to restore them
to their father.</p>

<p>The boys returned to school in high spirits,
and in the intervals of their studies practiced
strenuously in order to “make” the football
team. This time there were two other schools
besides Belden that they had to battle with, and
they found their work cut out for them. In fact
they came within an ace of losing the deciding
game, but how Bobby rose to the occasion and
carried the ball over the goal line for a touchdown
and a glorious victory is told in the volume
preceding this, entitled: “Bobby Blake On the
School Eleven; or, Winning the Banner of Blue
and Gold.”</p>

<p>And now on the very day following that victory,
we see Bobby working as he had never
worked before, to save the inmates of the sinking
boat from death in the icy waters of the lake.</p>

<p>The boys who had been thrown into the water
when the boat went down rose to the surface,
dashed the water from their eyes and looked
wildly about them.</p>

<p>They spied the advancing boat, which was now
close at hand, and two of them struck out for it.
A third tried to swim, but seemed to be so chilled
and bewildered that he could make no progress.
He did manage, however, to keep his head above
water. The fourth, it was evident could not swim
at all. He splashed about feebly for a moment
and then sank.</p>

<p>By this time Bobby’s boat was right among
them. The two foremost swimmers grabbed the
stern, as the boys suspended rowing. Bobby
reached over and grabbed a third one, who almost
pulled him out of the boat.</p>

<p>Just then the water broke alongside and the
head of the boy who had gone down appeared.
His eyes were glassy, and he was almost unconscious.
Lee was the nearest one to him and
reached over to grab him. He caught his hair,
but the drowning boy’s weight was too great, and
the boat tipped so sharply that Lee was dragged
over the gunwale.</p>

<p>He came up spluttering and gasping, but still
holding on to the other. Bobby surrendered the
boy he was holding to Fred, and grasping an oar
held it out to Lee. The latter caught it and
Bobby pulled him up to the side of the boat.</p>

<p>“Take him in first!” gasped Lee, indicating
his helpless burden. “I can hold on to the boat.”</p>

<p>By using all their strength and being especially
careful not to upset the boat, the rescuers lifted
the half drowned boy on board. Then came Lee’s
turn and that of the other three, two of whom
managed to clamber over without help.</p>

<p>“Now,” said Bobby with a sigh of relief, when
all were safely in the boat. “We’ve got to work
like beavers to get back to shore. It’s no joke
to be soaked to the skin on so cold a day as this.
Here, Lee,” he went on, turning to the shivering
lad, “take this coat of mine.”</p>

<p>“I won’t do it,” said Lee, “You need it yourself.”</p>

<p>“Not a bit of it,” replied Bobby. “I’ve been
rowing so hard I’m all in a sweat, and the work
getting home will keep me warmer than I’ll want
to be. You’ve just got to take it.”</p>

<p>Despite Lee’s protest, Bobby put the coat
around him. Fred and Sparrow followed suit
with regard to the other boys, whom they made
lie down in the boat so as to escape the wind.
Then they took the oars and pulled vigorously for
the shore.</p>

<p>Cheers greeted them as they approached.
The news of what was going on had spread like
wildfire, and all of Rockledge School was down
at the shore, including Doctor Raymond, the head
of the institution, and Mr. Leith and Mr. Carrier,
two teachers. A doctor also had been summoned
and many of the townspeople had hurried on foot
and in autos to the spot.</p>

<p>There was a hubbub of excited exclamations, as
the boat reached the little landing stage. The
spectators had seen the figures dragged aboard,
but from that distance could not tell whether
some of them were alive or dead.</p>

<p>The moment the boat slid alongside the float,
eager hands were outstretched to help, and great
was the relief when it was found that no life had
been lost.</p>

<p>The rescued ones were hurried up to the school,
where their wet clothes were stripped from them
and they were given hot drinks and placed between
warm blankets.</p>

<p>Doctor Raymond was so busy in supervising
this work that he had no time more than to tell
the rescuers that he was proud of them and would
see them later in his study. But others crowded
around them and made much of them, while
showering them with questions.</p>

<p>“It was nothing at all,” said Bobby with characteristic
modesty. “We simply happened to be
nearest and the boat was handy and we piled in
and rowed out to them. Any one else would have
done the same if the chance had come to them,
and you fellows are making too much out of it.”</p>

<p>“That’s all very well,” said Skeets Brody with
a grin, “but I notice just the same that when
anything has to be done and done in a hurry it’s
Bobby Blake that’s ‘Johnny on the spot’.”</p>

</div>

<div id='chIII' class='chapter'>
<h2>CHAPTER III<br/>A CLOSE CALL</h2>

<p class='first'>Now that the danger was over, the crowd began
to melt away, and the boys, who in the excitement
had forgotten all about lunch, suddenly remembered
that they had been overlooking what
was to all of them a duty and to most of them a
pleasure and made a break for the dining hall.</p>

<p>Pee Wee was especially remorseful that he had
so far forgotten himself.</p>

<p>“Gee!” he observed, as he took out his watch.
“Lunch time has been over for more than half
an hour. I hope they haven’t cleared the table.”</p>

<p>“If they haven’t, you will when you get to it,”
jibed Skeets. “That’s one place where you can
be depended on to work.”</p>

<p>“That isn’t work—it’s fun,” admitted Pee
Wee, as he started to put his watch back in his
pocket. But in his haste it dropped from his
fingers and fell with a bang to the ground.</p>

<p>There was an exclamation from the boys, who
crowded around Pee Wee as he looked ruefully
at the watch, whose crystal had been broken.</p>

<p>“Did it stop?” asked Fred.</p>

<p>“Of course it stopped when it hit the ground,”
put in Billy. “What did you expect it to do—go
right through to China?”</p>

<p>Pee Wee favored Billy with a glare that expressed
his opinion of that lad’s frivolity.</p>

<p>“Of all the idiots—” he began, and then words
failed him and he tapped his forehead significantly.</p>

<p>Nothing abashed, the graceless Billy grinned.</p>

<p>“It wasn’t so bad,” he said complacently. “I
don’t know how those things come to me but they
do—just like that,” he added snapping his fingers
airily.</p>

<p>“He hates himself—I don’t think,” remarked
Fred, making a playful pass at Billy, who dodged
so adroitly that the blow passed over his head
and caught the luckless Pee Wee in the stomach
almost making him drop his watch again.</p>

<p>“Say, what are you up to?” he demanded indignantly,
rubbing the injured spot with his hand.
“Haven’t I had hard luck enough for one day
without you fellows rubbing it in?”</p>

<p>“You seem to be doing all the rubbing,”
laughed Fred. “Sorry, old boy, but that stomach
of yours is so big that nothing can miss it.”</p>

<p>“Stop picking on poor little Pee Wee,”
chuckled Sparrow. “Cheer up, Pee Wee. What
if another Ingersoll did bite the dust? You’ll
have a good excuse now for being late at recitations.”</p>

<p>This silver lining to the cloud was not without
its effect on Pee Wee, and putting the battered
watch into his pocket, successfully this time, he
hurried to the dining hall, where the savory odors
of the meal that the housekeeper had prepared
soon made him forget all his troubles.</p>

<p>The boys at the tables were bubbling over with
interest at the stirring events they had witnessed,
and Bobby and the rest of his crew had all they
could do in answering the questions that were
showered upon them.</p>

<p>“Don’t you feel awfully sore and used up,
Bobby?” queried Howell Purdy, his voice a little
muffled because his mouth was so full.</p>

<p>“Not so very,” responded Bobby. “I suppose
I will to-morrow though. The second day
is always worse than the first.”</p>

<p>“If our boys ever pulled that way in a race,
we’d have no trouble in beating out Belden,” remarked
Shiner. “You fellows were simply lifting
that boat out of the water. As it was, you
didn’t get there a minute too soon either.”</p>

<p>“Not a second too soon,” corrected Sparrow.
“That fellow who couldn’t swim will never come
nearer to death than he was to-day. My heart
was just about in my mouth when I saw him go
down.”</p>

<p>“Lee had a close call too when he was pulled
overboard,” put in Skeets.</p>

<p>“Oh, as for that, Lee can swim like a fish,”
remarked Fred. “But he got a wetting just the
same and had to sit in his wet clothes until we
got back to the float. I hope it hasn’t hurt him.”</p>

<p>“He isn’t very strong, but he’s as plucky as
they make them,” commented Skeets, “and he
certainly knows how to swing an oar.”</p>

<p>“We had one bit of luck to help us out,” said
Bobby, “and that was that one of the boats
hadn’t been put away in canvas. If it had been,
we could never have got it out in time. As it
was, it was close to the door, so we could slide it
out in a jiffy.”</p>

<p>When at last the meal was finished and even
Pee Wee had had enough to eat, Bobby’s first
thought was of Lee. He saw Mr. Carrier hurrying
through the hall and asked him about the
Southern boy whom he had already learned to
like very much.</p>

<p>“Lee Cartier was very badly chilled,” was Mr.
Carrier’s response, “and that, combined with
over exertion, has made the doctor a little anxious
about him. I guess it would be better for
you boys not to see him for a while. But the
other boys are getting along all right, and they
just told me that they would like to see you and
the other members of the boat crew that rescued
them. By the way, Blake, you and the other
boys who went with you did nobly to-day and
I’m proud of you. It was a splendid piece of
work.”</p>

<p>Bobby flushed at the praise and would have
disclaimed any special credit, but Mr. Carrier
smiled and went on. Bobby hunted up Sparrow
and Fred, and the three went to the room which
had been placed at the disposal of the boys they
had rescued.</p>

<p>They found the four seated before a glowing
fire, wrapped in hot blankets and eating with
evident relish an abundant meal that had been
brought up to them. Apart from their rumpled
hair, they bore no sign of the ordeal through which
they had passed, and which had so nearly cost
the lives of all of them.</p>

<p>They jumped to their feet as their three rescuers
came in and surrounded them, shaking
hands and offering fervent thanks for the help
they had brought them at the moment of their
deepest need.</p>

<p>“Why, you are Belden boys!” exclaimed
Bobby, as he took a good look at them. “I suppose
I ought to have known that before, but I
was so busy that I didn’t have a chance to see
much of your faces.”</p>

<p>“Then, too, we looked so much like drowned
rats that you probably wouldn’t have recognized
us anyway,” laughed the eldest one of the quartette.
“Yes, we’re Belden boys, all right, and
live ones too, thanks to you. If it hadn’t been
for you fellows, all four of us would have been
at the bottom of the lake by this time. My name
is Wilson and this is Thompson and this is Livingston
and this is Miner,” he added, introducing
himself and his companions.</p>

<p>“I know Livingston and Miner already,” responded
Bobby, after having introduced Sparrow
and Fred in turn. “They played against
our team in the football game yesterday.”</p>

<p>“Sure thing,” agreed Livingston, while Miner
smiled assent, “and we didn’t think when we were
trying to keep you away from our goal line then
that you’d be saving our lives to-day.”</p>

<p>“Tell us how it all happened,” said Bobby, as
the party seated themselves comfortably before
the open fire.</p>

<p>“I suppose it was a bit of foolishness on our
part,” replied Wilson, who seemed by common
consent to be the spokesman of the Belden group,
“and I’m the most foolish of the lot, because I
was the one who proposed the trip. We were all
feeling a little sore and blue over the defeat our
team suffered yesterday, and to get our minds
off it I proposed to the rest of the fellows here
that we should take a row on the lake. We noticed
a little water in the bottom of the boat when
we started, but thought that might be due to the
rain we had a few days ago. It was only when
we had got out beyond the middle of the lake that
we noticed that the boat was leaking badly. We
tried to stuff the leak with, our handkerchiefs, but
in jabbing them in with an oar, we pushed too
hard and widened the crack so that we could do
nothing with it, and the water began to come in
faster than we could bail it out. This side of the
lake was the nearer, and we began to pull toward
it as hard as we could. It was just about that
time I guess that you saw us. I tell you we felt
good when we saw you rush to the landing and
get out the boat. It braced us up and made us
keep up the fight till the last minute. But toward
the end I thought it was all up with us. Thompson
here was the worst off of any of us, for he
can’t swim a stroke.”</p>

<p>“I sure thought that I was a goner,” broke in
Thompson. “I think I must have gone all
through the pain of drowning, for the last thing
I remember was that my lungs seemed bursting.
I don’t even recall being pulled into the boat. It
sure was a close call.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” agreed Bobby soberly as he gazed into
the fire, “it was a close call.”</p>

</div>

<div id='chIV' class='chapter'>
<h2>CHAPTER IV<br/>FACING THE BULLY</h2>

<p class='first'>There was silence in the room for a minute or
two. The boys all sensed the nearness of the
tragedy that had been so narrowly averted, and
each had an inward shudder as he thought of what
might have been.</p>

<p>But though the death angel had passed so
close that they had almost heard the rustling of
his wings, here they were after all alive and safe,
and their spirits rose while their hearts swelled
with thankfulness.</p>

<p>“Well,” remarked Wilson, breaking the silence,
“this will be a lesson to me, as the darky
said when he was about to be hanged. I don’t
get in any more boats unless they’re as dry as a
bone.”</p>

<p>“And even then I’ll keep out of them,” said
Thompson with emphasis. “Dry land is good
enough for me, at least, until I learn how to
swim.”</p>

<p>“Wouldn’t care to have us row you back to
Belden, eh?” queried Bobby with a grin.</p>

<p>“Not on your life,” laughed Miner. “They’ve
’phoned over that they’ll send an auto for us and
we’ll go back in style. But we’ll never forget till
the last day of our lives what you fellows have
done for us. And if I ever hear any fellow knock
Rockledge, he’ll have a fight on his hands right
away.”</p>

<p>Bobby laughed, as he and his two companions
rose to go.</p>

<p>“Oh, Belden and Rockledge will have many a
fight yet,” he said, “but they’ll be good-natured
fights on the baseball or football fields, and may
the best school win.”</p>

<p>They exchanged hearty farewells with the Belden
boys, and went out of the room and down the
corridor. On the way they passed Bill Snath,
who favored them with a malicious stare in passing
and uttered the word “heroes,” in a sneering
tone, as he went by. It was spoken in a low tone,
but loud enough for Fred, who was nearest him,
to hear it, and his temper took fire at once.</p>

<p>“What was that you said, Bill Snath?” he demanded,
as he turned on his heel.</p>

<p>“Nobody spoke to you, redhead,” returned
Snath, snapping out the epithet with a good deal
of relish.</p>

<p>This was like a spark to powder, and Fred’s
face became as red as his hair.</p>

<p>“You take that back!” he cried, rushing up to
Snath, who had stopped and was regarding him
with a tantalizing grin.</p>

<p>“Suppose I don’t, what are you going to do
about it?” demanded the bully, his tone the more
confident because he could see behind Fred’s back
the tall figure of Mr. Leith, the head teacher,
coming up from the other end of the hall.</p>

<p>“I’ll show you what I’m going to do about it,”
Fred replied, and was starting to unbutton his
coat, when Bobby, who had come up, restrained
him.</p>

<p>“Mr. Leith’s coming, Fred,” he warned him.
“Cool off now and come along. He’s close behind
you now.”</p>

<p>There was no need of saying anything else, and
Fred by a great effort restrained himself. Mr.
Leith came by and looked curiously at the flushed
face of the boy. He said nothing however, but
when he had reached the other end of the hall
stood there as if in meditation.</p>

<p>“It’s lucky for you that he came along just
then,” Fred said in a low tone to the bully. “If
you have nerve enough to come somewhere out
of sight of the school, we’ll settle this thing right
now.”</p>

<p>“You’re three to one,” Snath replied. “If
you were alone I’d make you sing small.”</p>

<p>“They’ll only go along to see fair play,” answered
Fred. “But if you like, I’ll go with you
alone. I’ve taken about all I’m going to take
from you. Bill Snath.”</p>

<p>“You’ll have to take all I care to give you,”
drawled Snath, feeling perfectly safe as long as
Mr. Leith was in sight.</p>

<p>As at that moment Mr. Leith began to come
back along the hall, there was nothing more to be
done or said and the boys separated, Snath
sauntering toward the teacher with affected nonchalance,
while Fred with Bobby and Sparrow went in the opposite
direction.</p>

<p>“That fellow gets my goat,” growled Fred.
“He never goes past without a nasty look or
word. He’s getting just as bad as Sandy Jackson,
and he needs to be taken down.”</p>

<p>“He’s aching for a thrashing,” agreed Bobby,
“and that’s twice to-day he’s come near getting
it. But if I were you, Fred, I’d take as little
notice of him as I could. If you hadn’t paid any
attention to what he said about heroes, he’d have
thought we didn’t hear him, and that would have
made him sore. As it is, he’s tickled to death
because he thinks he put one over on us.”</p>

<p>“But he called me redhead!” exclaimed Fred,
“and no one can do that in earnest without a
fight.”</p>

<p>“That of course is different,” admitted Bobby.
“I wouldn’t let any one call me names and get
away with it. But as far as we can, the best
thing is to let him alone. Some time or other
he’ll get to the end of his rope, just as his pal did
and get out of Rockledge School.”</p>

<p>“I guess Bobby’s about right,” remarked
Sparrow. “I suppose it’s always better to go
round a skunk than take a kick at him. But I
don’t blame Fred for feeling sore. I feel the
same way.”</p>

<p>The chums went out on the steps of the school,
where they found a group of their friends waiting
for them.</p>

<p>“How are the fellows getting along who were
nearly drowned?” asked Skeets.</p>

<p>“Fine and dandy,” replied Fred, who by this
time had regained his usual good nature. “Not
one of them is going to kick the bucket. And
what do you think, fellows? They’re all Belden
boys.”</p>

<p>“Belden boys!” echoed Shiner. “Our chief
rivals! That’s what you call heaping coals of
fire on their head.”</p>

<p>“I guess coals of fire would have felt comfortable
when they were out in the lake,” laughed
Mouser. “But I’m mighty glad they’re getting
along all right. If any of them had died, I’d expect
to hear their ghosts walking about the halls
of the building to-night.”</p>

<p>“Listen, to him talk,” said Howell Purdy
scornfully. “You can’t hear ghosts walk. They
just float around as soft as anything.”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” came in a chorus from the
boys, who had involuntarily gathered a little
closer together at the talk of ghosts.</p>

<p>“No, he isn’t right,” chirped up Billy.
“Mouser had it straight when he talked about
hearing ghosts walking.”</p>

<p>“There you are,” said Mouser, glad of the
reinforcement.</p>

<p>“It’s easy enough to say that,” put in Howell,
“but how are you going to prove it? All the
books I ever read say that they don’t make any
noise. You can’t bear them coming. So what do
you make of that?” he added turning triumphantly
toward Billy.</p>

<p>The latter however seemed not to be a bit disturbed.</p>

<p>“All the same I’m right,” he asserted with
quiet confidence.</p>

<p>“How can you prove it?” demanded Howell
defiantly.</p>

<p>“That’s the talk” came from the others.
“Prove it, Billy. Put up or shut up.”</p>

<p>“All right,” replied Billy, accepting the challenge.
“I know that ghosts walk because I’ve
heard them do it!”</p>

</div>

<div id='chV' class='chapter'>
<h2>CHAPTER V<br/>PUTTING ONE OVER</h2>

<p class='first'>There was a shout of amazement from the boys
in which could be detected an element of unbelief
and derision. But there was also a note of awe
that was balm to Billy’s soul. Any one who was
so familiar with the supernatural was not to be
regarded lightly. Billy felt that he had scored
a decided hit and swelled out his chest importantly.</p>

<p>“When did you hear them walk?” asked Skeets,
looking about him a little apprehensively.</p>

<p>“You’re just kidding,” declared Shiner,
stoutly. “I don’t believe a word of it.”</p>

<p>“I think that Billy’s getting us on a string,”
affirmed Fred, although his eager eyes showed
that he was none too sure of it.</p>

<p>Billy waited for the storm of protest and comment
to subside.</p>

<p>“I mean just what I said,” he affirmed.
“Cross my heart and hope to die if I don’t.”</p>

<p>This solemn affirmation helped to quell the
doubters, especially as there was nothing to
arouse suspicion in Billy’s sober face.</p>

<p>“Well then, tell us all about it,” urged Mouser,
who was anxious to obtain confirmation of his
own belief.</p>

<p>“It was in our town when old General Bixby
was buried,” explained Billy, amid a silence in
which one could have heard a pin drop. “There
was a big turnout and the band played awful
solemn music.”</p>

<p>He paused for a moment.</p>

<p>“Yes, go on, go on,” urged Skeets excitedly.
“Was it then that you heard the ghosts walk?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Billy. “It was then that I
heard the Dead March.”</p>

<p>There was a moment of stupefaction, as the
idea filtered into the minds of Billy’s dupes.
Bobby grasped it first.</p>

<p>“Run, Billy run!” he counseled. “They’ll kill
you for that!”</p>

<p>But Billy had already edged his way to the rim
of the group and by the time they lunged for him
was safely out of reach. Then he danced a jig
and went through various gestures expressive of
his pity and contempt for the victims who had
let themselves so readily be taken in.</p>

<p>“It’s too easy,” he shouted. “It really isn’t
sportsmanlike to take advantage of such innocent
boobs. It’s like taking candy from a baby.”</p>

<p>“It’s no use,” declared Bobby. “Billy is a
hopeless case.”</p>

<p>“He sure is,” agreed Mouser, whose faith in
ghosts had received a severe bump. “I was
watching his face too, but he was so sober that I
fell for it and fell good and hard. The only
satisfaction is that the rest of you fell for it
too.”</p>

<p>Just then Dr. Raymond, the head of the school
approached, and the boys subsided. The doctor
smiled pleasantly at the group and singled out
Bobby.</p>

<p>“I’d like to have you come to my office in a
few minutes, Blake,” he said, “and you also
Martin and Bangs. I have something to say to
you.”</p>

<p>“Very well, sir,” the boys assented.</p>

<p>The doctor passed on, and the boys looked at
each other. Usually an invitation to the doctor’s
office portended something unpleasant, and was
not looked forward to with any degree of enthusiasm.</p>

<p>“Now you’re going to catch it,” chaffed Skeets.</p>

<p>“What have you roughnecks been up to now?”
demanded Shiner with mock severity.</p>

<p>“Perhaps he’s going to scold you for falling
for my jokes,” Billy rubbed it in.</p>

<p>But the three who had been summoned only
smiled. There had been times after midnight
spreads and other escapades, when such an invitation
would have made them decidedly uneasy.
But just at the moment their consciences were
clear, and it was without misgiving that a few
minutes later they knocked at the doctor’s door
and were told to come in.</p>

<p>The doctor was seated at his desk, but rose as
they entered and motioned them to seats. He
was a tall, rather spare man of middle age, with
keen eyes and the face of a scholar, in which
could be seen also the experience of a man of affairs.
There was an air of natural dignity about
him that warned any one that he would be an unsafe
man to trifle with. But although he was a
strict disciplinarian and the boys stood in
wholesome awe of him, he was yet tolerant and
broadminded and absolutely just. Any boy that was
summoned before him for an alleged offense could be
certain of being heard in his own defense, and
of getting a “square deal;” and wherever possible,
justice would be tempered with mercy.</p>

<p>He had built up a reputation for Rockledge
School that was spread far and wide. His instructors
were well chosen, the manners and morals of the
boys were carefully looked after, and parents had
no hesitation in confiding their boys to his keeping.
The institution was fortunate in its location,
standing on the shores of Monatook Lake, a beautiful
body of water, which afforded facilities for bathing,
boating and fishing in Summer and for skating and
other ice sports in Winter. In addition to these
natural advantages, the school had a well-equipped
gymnasium and excellently laid out fields for football,
baseball and other sports. For training both the mind
and the body, Rockledge School left little to be
desired; and this was so well understood in that part
of the country that there was usually a waiting list
of applicants for admission to the strictly limited
number of pupils.</p>

<p>“I have sent for you boys,” the doctor said,
after they had seated themselves, “to thank you
on behalf of myself and the school for the gallant
thing you did to-day in saving those boys
from drowning in the lake. It took a lot of pluck
and hard work, and I’m proud of you.”</p>

<p>The boys looked embarrassed.</p>

<p>“How is Lee Cartier getting along, Dr. Raymond?”
asked Bobby eagerly, glad to change
the subject. “Mr. Carrier told me that he
wasn’t well enough for us to see him.”</p>

<p>The doctor’s face took on a worried look.</p>

<p>“It’s a little early to tell yet,” be replied.
“Dr. Evans, who has just gone, told me that the
drenching he had received and the exposure afterward
while you were getting back to shore had
been a severe shock to his system. He comes
from the South, you know, and hasn’t been up
here long enough to get hardened to our climate.
There is a possibility that he may be in for a
serious illness. Still, we’ll hope for the best. I
won’t keep you any longer,” he said, rising as a
signal of dismissal, “but I want once more to say
to you that you have done honor to yourselves
and the school.”</p>

<p>The boys bowed themselves out and closed the
door behind them.</p>

<p>“The doctor’s a brick, isn’t he?” remarked
Fred, as they went down the hall.</p>

<p>“You bet he is,” agreed Sparrow. “He’s the
real goods.”</p>

<p>“He’s all wool and a yard wide,” was Bobby’s
tribute to the head of Rockledge School.</p>

<p>A week passed swiftly by and then another, and
by that time Winter had come in earnest. There
had as yet been no snow, but the weather had
become intensely cold and the lake was beginning to
freeze over. At first, the ice looked like a
gigantic spider’s web shooting out in shimmering
threads until the entire surface was covered with
a crystal coating. Then the ice began to thicken
at the shores, and it was evident that with the
continuance of the cold weather it would soon be
possible to skate from one end of the lake to the
other.</p>

<p>Skates were gotten out and polished and sharpened.
Some of the boys busied themselves with
making ice sails, which they could hold in their
hands and which would carry them like the wind
along the glassy surface without the expenditure
of any effort of their own, save what was required
to hold the sails. This contrivance had a
special appeal to Pee Wee, who was a profound
believer in any device that would save labor.
He was far too lazy however to make one for
himself and had written home asking his folks to
buy and send him one. To the other boys’ suggestion
that it be especially reinforced or made of
sheet iron, he turned a deaf and scornful ear.</p>

<p>But before the ice was quite hard enough to be
trusted, the snow took a hand. Up to then there
had been nothing but a few flurries that did
scarcely more than whiten the ground. But one
afternoon, as the boys came out of their last
recitations, they saw that the skies were lowering
and that a steady snowstorm was in progress.</p>

<p>Ordinarily this would have been welcomed, but
just now the boys had their minds set on skating,
so that the sight of the whirling flakes was something
of a disappointment.</p>

<p>“There goes our skating up the flue,” commented
Shiner, as he looked on the ground on which there
was already an inch of snow. “The lake will be no
good, if it’s all covered with snow.”</p>

<p>“And by the time the snow’s ready to melt,
the ice will melt too,” mourned Sparrow.</p>

<p>“And I just got a notice from the express
company this morning that my ice sail was
there,” complained Pee Wee.</p>

<p>“Oh, stop your grouching, you poor fish,” said
Bobby. “In the first place the snow may not
amount to anything. In the second place, if it
does, we can get busy and sweep off enough of
the ice on the lake to skate on. And in the third
place, what we may miss in skating we can make
up in coasting.”</p>

<p class='in2'>“‘The fellow worth while is the one that can smile<br/>
When everything’s going dead wrong,’”</p>

<p>chanted Skeets. “I guess that means Bobby,”
he added, giving the latter a nudge in the ribs.</p>

<p>“Well, what have we got to growl about anyway?”
said Fred, falling into his chum’s mood.
“Here we are well and strong and able to put
away three square meals a day”—here Pee Wee
pricked up his ears. “Now if we were shut up
in a room like Lee Cartier, we might have something
to kick about.”</p>

<p>“Poor Lee!” remarked Bobby regretfully.
“He’s certainly had a rough deal. He’s lucky of
course that he didn’t get pneumonia. But it’s no
joke to be kept in his room so long. I’m going
over to see him for a while as soon as supper
is over.”</p>

<p>Which he did, accompanied by Fred and Sparrow,
who had expressed a desire to go along.</p>

</div>

<div id='chVI' class='chapter'>
<h2>CHAPTER VI<br/>FIRE!</h2>

<p class='first'>The other schoolboys found Lee in the private
room that had been set apart for him, propped
up with pillows in a big easy chair and wrapped
snugly in a bathrobe. His face was pale from
his illness, but it lighted up when he saw his visitors.</p>

<p>“I was just wishing you fellows would drop
in,” he said, as they shook hands with him and
pulled their chairs up close.</p>

<p>“It must get awful poky cooped up in the room
so long,” said Bobby sympathetically.</p>

<p>“It sure does,” rejoined the boy from the
South. “Of course I have books to read that
help to pass away the time, but that isn’t like being
with the fellows. Not that I’ve read very
much this afternoon,” he went on, “because I’ve
been too busy looking at the snow. Do you know
that this is the first real snow storm I have ever
seen?”</p>

<p>“Is that so?” queried Fred in astonishment.
“We see so much of it every year that it gets
to be an old story with us.”</p>

<p>“You’ve got an awful lot of fun coming to
you,” put in Sparrow. “There’s skating and ice
sailing and coasting and snowballing and lots of
things.”</p>

<p>“Not forgetting muskratting and fishing
through the ice,” added Fred. “Maybe we didn’t
have a lot of fun the winter we spent up in
Snowtop Camp, eh, fellows?”</p>

<p>“You bet we did,” agreed Sparrow, and
launched into a long description of that memorable
winter holiday in the Big Woods, not forgetting
the bear and the wildcat and the snowslide
that buried the house, and other adventures, to all
of which Lee Cartier listened with the most rapt
attention and interest.</p>

<p>“It must have been great,” he murmured with
a sigh of envy. “I can see that I’ve got a lot
of fun waiting for me as soon as I can get outdoors
again. And I hope it won’t be long till then.
The doctor said to-day that I could probably be
outdoors in a week.”</p>

<p>“That’s bully,” said Bobby. “But do you
really mean, Lee, that you’ve never seen snow
before?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ve seen little flurries of it once or twice,”
replied Lee, “but it’s never amounted to anything,
and it’s melted just as soon as it struck
the ground. Down in Louisiana, where I come
from, it’s practically summer all the year round.
While it’s been snowing here to-day, people have
been going in swimming down there. The darkeys are
going round barefooted, women are fanning
themselves, and men are going round on
the shady side of the street.”</p>

<p>“Nobody getting sunstruck, is there?” queried
Fred with a grin.</p>

<p>“Well, perhaps not as bad as that,” smiled
Lee, “but take it altogether it’s almost as different
there from what it is here as day is from night.”</p>

<p>“I saw a picture the other day of some boys
shinning up cocoanut trees somewhere in the
middle of January,” remarked Sparrow. “It seems
funny to think there should be such differences
in the same country.”</p>

<p>“I’d like to spend some time down South,”
said Bobby. “I’ve been out West and almost
everywhere else in the country except the South.
Of course we had a taste of what it was like when
we went to Porto Rico. But I’d like to be somewhere
in the South for weeks at a time, and learn
just how different things are from what they are
here up North.”</p>

<p>“You’d enjoy it all right,” affirmed Lee.
“You can fairly live outdoors all the year round,
and you’d find lots of things that would be strange
and interesting. I’d like to have you on my place
where I could go round with you and show you
the sights.”</p>

<p>“That would be fine,” agreed Bobby. “What
town in Louisiana do you live in, Lee?”</p>

<p>“I don’t live in any town,” replied Lee. “The
nearest town is Raneleigh, and that isn’t much
more than a store and a railroad station. Mother
and I live on a plantation. My folks have lived
there for generations. My great-grandfather
had the property in the old days when Louisiana
belonged to France.”</p>

<p>“I guessed you were French or of French descent
because of the name,” said Bobby. “Let’s
see, wasn’t there a Cartier who had something to
do with the discovery of America?”</p>

<p>“There was a Cartier who discovered parts of
America in 1534,” replied Lee, “and he, I believe,
was an ancestor of mine. That’s one bit
of history that’s been pretty well dinned into
me,” he added with a smile. “Our people, you
know, put a lot of value on their ancestry, though
I never cared much for it. My mother too was
of French descent, as one can tell from her first
name, Celeste.”</p>

<p>“Is the plantation a big one?” asked Bobby.</p>

<p>“Pretty big,” replied Lee, “though not
as big as it was before the Civil War. That
was in the days when people kept slaves, and
our folk had a lot of them and thousands of acres
of land. But after the war was over, a lot of the
land was sold, and now we have only a few hundred
acres. And I don’t know how long we’ll
have that,” he added, a shadow coming over his
brow.</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” asked Fred with ready
sympathy.</p>

<p>“Oh, we’re having trouble about the boundary
lines of the property,” explained Lee. “Some
of the stones that mark the lines are missing, and
there’s a neighbor of ours named Boolus who’s
claiming part of the property. We’re sure he is
wrong, but we’re not able to prove it, and he’s
making us lots of trouble. He’s one of the
meanest men in the parish and everybody hates
and despises him. But he’s got lots of money
and tricky lawyers, and it looks as though he
were going to get the best of us. But I don’t
want to bother you about my troubles,” Lee
added, brightening up. “I only wish I had you
fellows down with me on the plantation while we
still own it. I think I might be able to show you
lots of things that would make you open your
eyes, such as alligators and—”</p>

<p>“Alligators!” exclaimed Fred. “Do you have
them down there?”</p>

<p>“You see you’ve made Fred open his eyes already,”
said Bobby with a laugh.</p>

<p>“There are lots of them,” said Lee, “and big
ones too. There’s a big swamp on the edge of
our property that they say is full of them. It’s
lots of fun hunting them.”</p>

<p>“Have you ever hunted them?” asked Sparrow
with intense interest.</p>

<p>“I’ve never gone after them alone,” replied
Lee, “but I’ve gone along with hunting parties
and seen them caught.”</p>

<p>“How do they do it?” asked Fred.</p>

<p>“They dig them out of their holes,” explained
Lee, pleased that he could tell the boys something
outside the range of their experience. “You see
the alligators have holes or burrows in the
neighborhood of the water, where they crawl in
at times. The hunters go along until they spy
one of these burrows, which are not very deep
below the surface of the ground. Then one of
them takes a stout rope, makes a noose in it and
hangs this over the entrance to the hole. Others
take a sharp spear or stake, and prod into the
ground above where they know the alligator is
lying. That stirs him up and he crawls out of
his hole to see what’s the matter. As he comes
out he sticks his head into the noose, and the man
above tightens it before he can back out. The
brute tries to pull back into his burrow, but all
hands get hold of the rope and yank him out.
As his body appears, other ropes are passed
around him, and by the time he’s all out he’s
pretty well trussed up. Sometimes though, he
puts up an awful fight and breaks the ropes, and
then you have to look out. If you ever come
within reach of his jaws or the swish of his tail,
it’s all up with you.”</p>

<p>“It must be awfully exciting,” exclaimed Fred.</p>

<p>“It is that all right,” agreed Lee. “Then we
have lots of other sports in which there’s plenty
of fun. There’s badger hunting, and coon hunting
with the dogs at night, and once in a while a
panther comes round, and take it altogether there
isn’t much dullness on the plantation. I only
wish you fellows could share the fun with me.”</p>

<p>“There’s nothing I’d like better,” said Bobby,
and his companions nodded assent. “But Louisiana’s
a long way off, and I guess we’ll have to
take it out in wishing. I suppose we’ll have to
go now,” he added, reaching for his cap, “though
I’d like to stay for hours and hear you tell us
things about the South.”</p>

<p>“It’s done me a lot of good to have you fellows
drop in,” said Lee. “The days seem
mighty long here with no one but the doctor and
the nurse to see and talk to. Come in again just
as often as you can.”</p>

<p>“We sure will,” replied Bobby, “and you must
hurry and get well so as to be around with us
again.”</p>

<p>That night Bobby found it hard to get to sleep.
The talk with Lee had brought novel ideas into
his mind, and he lay awake for a long time, conjuring
up visions of what life must be on a plantation.</p>

<p>When at last he did fall asleep, he dreamed
that he was pushing a flatboat along a Louisiana
lagoon. On the shores about him were a number
of what seemed to be logs of wood. Suddenly
one of them moved and slipped into the water,
and he saw that it was an alligator. One after
the other, things that looked like logs did the
same. The presence of so many of the ugly
brutes made him uneasy, and he made his craft
move faster to get out of the vicinity as soon as
possible. Just as he was congratulating himself
that he had gotten out of the danger zone, the
water broke at the side of the boat, and a pair of
great jaws appeared, above which were the menacing
eyes of a big alligator. The brute made a
lunge at the boat and nearly overturned it.
Bobby tried to beat him off with the pole, and
while he was doing so, another alligator appeared
on the other side of the boat. A moment more
and the water was fairly alive with the fearsome
creatures, and Bobby was surrounded by a circle
of open jaws and frightful teeth and flaming
eyes. He struck out desperately, but to no avail.
The circle closed around him, and one of the
brutes with a blow of his tail stove in the side
of the boat. He felt himself sinking, saw a terrible
pair of jaws reach out to seize him and—woke
up to find himself sitting bolt upright in
bed while a cold sweat bedewed his forehead.</p>

<p>It was a minute or so before he could realize
that it had been only a dream, and then with a
feeling of immense relief he adjusted his pillow
and burrowed his head into its soft folds.</p>

<p>The snow was beating against the windows, and
the contrast between the wintry storm and the
hot lagoon of his dream brought a smile to his
lips.</p>

<p>“Gee!” he said to himself. “If any alligators
were up this way they’d freeze to death sure.”</p>

<p>He lay listening in dreamy content, when he
became conscious of another noise that was not
like that of the snow on the windows. It sounded
more like a crackling. He sat up in bed and
listened. The sound became more distinct. And
then to his nostrils came the odor of smoke.</p>

<p>He was out of bed in a twinkling. He opened
the door of his room and the odor grew stronger.
He traced it along the hall to the door of a storeroom
at the end of the corridor.</p>

<p>He flung open the door and fell back appalled.
The storeroom was a seething mass of fire!</p>

</div>

<div id='chVII' class='chapter'>
<h2>CHAPTER VII<br/>AT RISK OF LIFE</h2>

<p class='first'>For a moment Bobby’s heart stood still.</p>

<p>The next instant he had slammed the door shut,
so as to prevent the spread of the flames as much
as possible. Then he raced through the hall,
banging on the doors of the various rooms and
shouting at the top of his voice:</p>

<p>“Fire! Fire! The school is on fire!”</p>

<p>There was a sound of answering shouts from
the startled inmates of the rooms, and doors were
torn open, showing frightened and bewildered
faces.</p>

<p>Not stopping for a moment, Bobby ran up the
stairs to the room where hung the great bell of
the school. He grasped the rope and pulled it
back and forth with all his might, and the bell
sent out its clangor into the night, rousing the
people from their slumbers for miles around.</p>

<p>Down the stairs Bobby sprang and rushed to
the telephone. He called up the fire station in
the town of Rockledge and told the news, getting
an answer that the engine would be rushed out as
fast as possible.</p>

<p>Then Bobby ran back to his room, pushing his
way through the confused and shouting groups
of boys who had rushed into the halls in all stages
of dress and undress, and began hurriedly to
slip on his own clothes, answering as well as he
could the questions put by Fred, who was already
nearly dressed.</p>

<p>“Are the fellows all out?” asked Fred, as he
slipped on his jacket.</p>

<p>“I guess so,” replied Bobby, as he finished lacing
his shoes. “I banged on all the doors, and
then too the ringing of the bell would wake the
dead. I passed most of them already out in the
hall. Oh, but there’s Lee!” he fairly shouted,
jumping to his feet. “His room is off from the
rest and it’s just across from where the fire is!
We’ve got to get him out.”</p>

<p>He threw open the door and started down the
hall. But just then flames burst through the door
of the burning room and swept completely across
the hall, barring the passage.</p>

<p>Like a flash, Bobby was back in the room. He
seized a towel and thrust it into the pitcher of
water that stood on the washstand. Then he
wound the dripping folds about his head.</p>

<p>“Take the pitcher and dash the rest of the
water over me!” he shouted to Fred. “Quick!”</p>

<p>Fred did so and Bobby darted out of the room.</p>

<p>Down the hall he went and made a flying leap
through the flames holding his breath as he did so,
in order that he might not inhale the fire. He
reached Lee’s door and rushed in.</p>

<p>The room was full of smoke, and Lee, half
stupefied by it and hardly knowing what he was
doing was staggering about. Bobby grabbed
him by the arm and shook him.</p>

<p>“Brace up, Lee!” he cried.</p>

<p>With the other hand he picked up a heavy bathrobe
and threw it over Lee’s head and shoulders.
Then he started to lead him to the door, but Lee
had not been on his feet for so long that his knees
gave way under him.</p>

<p>At that instant, Fred, who had also drenched
himself from head to foot, appeared at his side,
and Bobby heaved a sigh of relief.</p>

<p>“Let’s wrap his head and shoulders in this
bathrobe,” panted Bobby. “Then you take his
feet and I’ll take his head, and we’ll make a break
to get through.”</p>

<p>Fred helped as directed, and closing their eyes
when they neared the darting flames, they got
through with their burden just in time to deliver
Lee into the hands of Dr. Raymond and Mr. Carrier,
who had come rushing in half dressed from
the adjoining building. The half-unconscious
boy was taken to a safe place and ministered to,
and then Dr. Raymond and the teachers turned
their attention to fighting the fire, first having
made sure that all the pupils were accounted
for.</p>

<p>By this time the flames had gained considerable
headway, and had broken through the partitions
into adjoining rooms. Hand grenades
were brought into use, but could do little toward
checking the fire. Then a bucket brigade was organized,
and the boys worked like Trojans in
passing the buckets from hand to hand. But the
flames were not entirely extinguished until help
arrived from the town. Then a powerful stream
was turned on and the fire was speedily gotten under
control.</p>

<p>It was after midnight before the danger was
over, and much later than that when the fire
company thought it safe to depart, leaving one of
their number to guard against any renewal of
the flame from the sodden and smouldering embers.</p>

<p>Then the boys, who were utterly fagged out
by the excitement and the hard work they had
been doing, had time to take an account of matters.
Some of the rooms had been burned out altogether,
including that occupied by Bobby and
Fred. They had had time however to remove
most of their clothes and personal belongings,
but the other contents of the rooms were practically
a total loss.</p>

<p>Personally they had gotten off with only trifling
hurts and burns. Fred’s hair had been singed
and Bobby’s hands had some blisters, incurred
by that rapid rush through the flames, and some
of the other boys had minor injuries, incurred
chiefly in the effort to save their belongings.
But none had perished and none had been seriously
hurt, and in this they found ample reason
for thanksgiving.</p>

<p>“Gee, Bobby, but it was lucky that you woke
up just then!” exclaimed Shiner. “If you hadn’t,
a lot of us might have been burned to death.”</p>

<p>“It’s lucky that I had that nightmare,” replied
Bobby with a grin, and he narrated the details
of his fight with the alligators in his dream.
“If I hadn’t been shocked awake by that,” he
concluded, “I’d have been as sound asleep as the
rest when the fire broke out.”</p>

<p>“It was an awful plucky thing that you and
Fred did when you went through the fire for Lee,”
commented Mouser. “A little later and nobody
could have got to him and he’d have been a goner
sure.”</p>

<p>“I only hope it hasn’t set him back,” replied
Bobby. “He wasn’t in shape to stand much excitement.”</p>

<p>Dr. Raymond and the rest of the teaching staff
came up just then to make arrangements for the
sleeping quarters of the boys who had been
turned out of their rooms. Some were doubled
up in rooms that had been left intact, and others
were taken over in the adjoining wing, where some
spare cots were installed for their use. None of
the boys felt that they could sleep any more that
night, but they obeyed orders just the same,
and as a matter of fact all of them were asleep
long before morning dawned.</p>

<p>Having seen them all provided for, the doctor
went back to his quarters, but not without first
having a word with Bobby and Fred.</p>

<p>“Again the school and myself are under a debt
to you, Blake,” he said. “You have shown
again the quality of which I spoke to you two
weeks ago, that of quick thinking. There is no
doubt that if you and Martin had not acted as
you did in regard to Cartier, he would have died
in the flames.”</p>

<p>“I never thought much of nightmares,” Bobby
said to Fred, later on, as they crept into bed,
“but I sure am glad I had that one. That dream
alligator that nearly had his teeth in me was the
best friend I ever had.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” agreed Fred, “and I’ll tell the world
that he was the best friend Rockledge School ever
had.”</p>

</div>

<div id='chVIII' class='chapter'>
<h2>CHAPTER VIII<br/>AN UNEXPECTED VACATION</h2>

<p class='first'>The boys bad been told before they retired that
there would be no lessons the next day, and the
breakfast hour was put one hour later, to the
satisfaction of all but Pee Wee, who was inclined
to question the wisdom of the arrangement.
To put off a meal on any pretext was to
him a violation of the proper order of things.
Still, as it occurred to him later, there was some
satisfaction in the thought that he would have a
better appetite and be able to eat more; and this
reconciled him to the situation.</p>

<p>Of course there was only one topic of conversation
among the boys during and after the meal.
The fire had banished everything else from their
minds and conjecture was rife as to what changes
if any it would make in the routine of the school.
The incidents of the night were gone over from
every angle, and the part that Bobby and Fred
had played was more discussed than any other
feature.</p>

<p>The boys made an inventory also of their personal
losses. In most cases that was not great.
One or two had forgotten watches or scarf pins
in the confusion, but cherished the hope that
some of these might be found in the debris when
the ruins had time to cool.</p>

<p>“I hope you didn’t lose your joke book, Billy,”
remarked Shiner.</p>

<p>“I hope you did,” put in Fred with a grin.</p>

<p>Billy looked scornfully at his would-be-tormentors.</p>

<p>“I don’t have to depend on any joke book,” he
replied loftily. “I get the best things I spring on
you dubs right out of here,” and he touched his
forehead.</p>

<p>“How can you?” queried Sparrow. “Mr.
Leith was telling us the other day that you
couldn’t get anything out of a vacuum because
there wasn’t anything in it.”</p>

<p>Billy favored him with a stony stare.</p>

<p>“Just to prove to you that you’re wrong,” he
said, “I’ll ask you fellows a simple question,
and I’m willing to bet that none of you can answer
it. That’ll show where the vacuums are.”</p>

<p>There was no immediate acceptance of the challenge,
and the scorn in Billy’s eyes became more
pronounced.</p>

<p>“Just as I thought,” he announced. “Every
one of you has rooms to let in his upper story.”</p>

<p>“Oh, well,” remarked Mouser, stung into acceptance,
“we’ve stood so many of Billy’s jokes
that one more won’t count. Go ahead, Billy, and
get it off your chest.”</p>

<p>The invitation was none too cordial, but Billy
pounced on it.</p>

<p>“All right,” he said, “here’s the question.
What’s the best material for footwear?”</p>

<p>“You tell him, razor, you’re sharp,” murmured
Shiner.</p>

<p>“You tell him, garter, you’ve got the snap,”
remarked Howell.</p>

<p>“You tell him, goldfish, you’ve been round the
globe,” put in Fred.</p>

<p>Billy glared at the dispensers of these frivolities.</p>

<p>“You fellows are just trying to gain time to
think up an answer,” he remarked cuttingly.
“Come across now with the answer and prove
that you’re not the dumb-bells I think you
are.”</p>

<p>“Why, leather is the best material for footwear
I suppose,” hazarded Bobby.</p>

<p>“Wood lasts a long time; lots of people wear
nothing but wooden shoes in Holland and other
places in Europe,” suggested Skeets.</p>

<p>“How about canvas?” queried Shiner. “I’ve
got a pair of tennis shoes that I’ve had for more
than two years, and they’re almost as good as
ever.”</p>

<p>“All wrong,” pronounced Billy. “You’ll
have to do better than that.”</p>

<p>They cudgeled their brains, but the list of possibilities
seemed about exhausted, and at last
they gave it up.</p>

<p>“Well, Billy, let’s have it,” said Fred. “What
is the best material for footwear?”</p>

<p>“Banana peels,” Billy answered promptly.</p>

<p>The boys looked blankly at each other.</p>

<p>“Come again,” urged Mouser, “I don’t get
you.”</p>

<p>“Why, you fatheads,” said Billy, “even you
ought to know that banana peels make the best
slippers.”</p>

<p>What might have happened to the perpetrator
of this outrage will never be known, for at that
moment a summons came from Dr. Raymond for
all the boys to come to the assembly hall of the
school.</p>

<p>When they obeyed and had all taken their
places, Dr. Raymond, who was seated on the platform
with Mr. Leith and Mr. Carrier, and who
looked worn and haggard after a sleepless night,
arose to speak.</p>

<p>“The fire of last night was of course a great
misfortune,” he said among other things, “not
especially in a financial sense, for, as you may
be glad to know, the building and furniture were
fully covered by insurance. But it is regrettable
that so many dormitory rooms were destroyed,
for it makes it necessary for some of the pupils
to suspend their studies for the month or more
that may be necessary before the part of the
school damaged by fire can be rebuilt. It may
be necessary for them to work a little harder
when they return in order to make up for lost
time. With the exception of those who are thus
excused, the work of the school will go on as
usual. While we all are sorry that the fire occurred,
that after all counts for little compared
with the fact no one was seriously injured. I
want before you all to say publicly what I have
already said to them personally, that Blake and
Martin by their quick thinking and brave action
have brought credit to themselves and honor to
Rockledge School.”</p>

<p>Following his remarks, he read the list of those
who would be given the unexpected and yet most
welcome vacation. The boys listened breathlessly,
each one hoping that he might be among
the favored ones, and when the reading finished
there were many stifled sighs of disappointment
on the part of the majority, while the eyes of the
elect glowed with satisfaction. Bobby and Fred
were on the list, as well as Mouser and Shiner
and Lee, but none of their other close friends
were included in the dozen or more to be excused.</p>

<p>The exodus was not to take place for a day or
two, because time was required for packing and
for proper notification of their parents. Telegrams
were already coming in from the latter who had heard
or read of the fire, and the teaching staff had
plenty of work in sending reassuring messages in
reply. How the fire had started was a mystery.</p>

<p>When finally the boys were dismissed, they
gathered in groups, discussing eagerly the program
that had been mapped out by the head of
the school. Some were jubilant, others despondent.</p>

<p>“Scubbity-yow!” cried Fred, executing a jig.
“Best news I’ve heard since Sitting Bull sat
down.”</p>

<p>“I love my books, but, oh! you vacation,”
chuckled Shiner.</p>

<p>“If you fellows fell in the water, you’d come
up with a fish in your mouth,” remarked Billy
enviously.</p>

<p>“Never mind, Billy,” comforted Fred. “You’ll
have all the more time to think up some poor
jokes to spring on us when we get back.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know any poor ones,” replied Billy.
“All of mine are good, too good anyway for
you boobs to guess, I notice. By the way,” he
continued, brightening up visibly, “here’s one of
the best I ever thought of. Why is—”</p>

<p>“Officer, he’s crazy again,” groaned Fred.</p>

<p>“Choke him off, somebody,” urged Mouser.</p>

<p>“But listen,” pleaded Billy.</p>

<p>“Not on your life,” was Shiner’s heartless rejoinder.
“Here’s where we get a chance, fellows,
to make Billy stew in his own juice. It’ll break
his heart to have a joke all ready to spring and
nobody to listen to it.”</p>

<p>“But you fellows don’t know what you’re missing,”
warned Billy. “Why ought a cook—”</p>

<p>“We’ll admit she ought, right off the reel,”
interrupted Skeets, “so suppose we let it go at
that.”</p>

<p>But Billy was not to be shaken from his prey,
and he held on like grim death.</p>

<p>“Why ought a cook to get good wages?” he
demanded.</p>

<p>“Because she needs the dough,” replied Mouser
promptly. The suddenness of the response nearly
took Billy off his feet.</p>

<p>“You must have heard that somewhere,” he
said in a crestfallen way.</p>

<p>“Noah sprang that on Mrs. Noah when they
were in the Ark,” jibed Mouser.</p>

<p>“I knew you wouldn’t have guessed it of your
own accord,” retorted Billy, getting at least that
much satisfaction out of his discomfiture.</p>

<p>Shortly after dinner, Bobby and Fred went to
call on Lee. They found him in much better condition
than they had expected. They had feared
that the excitement of his experience the night
before might have given him a set-back, but on the
contrary his eyes were bright, and there was
more color in his face than had been there at
any time since he had been taken ill.</p>

<p>He was fervent in his thanks to Bobby and
Fred for having saved his life, but they waved
these aside and made as light of their own part
in the proceedings as possible.</p>

<p>“It would certainly have been all up with me if
it hadn’t been for you fellows,” declared Lee. “I
suppose the smoke must have stupefied me before
you came, because I can just remember staggering
about the room without even having sense
enough to find the door. It was an awfully
plucky thing for you boys to do, and I owe it to
you that I’m not dead this minute.”</p>

<p>“You certainly look to be far enough from
dead now,” laughed Bobby.</p>

<p>“Perhaps the shock and shaking up did me
good instead of harm,” rejoined the boy from the
South. “I certainly feel better than I did at this
time yesterday.”</p>

<p>“All the same, I guess the doctor wouldn’t prescribe
it,” said Fred with a grin.</p>

<p>“Probably not,” smiled Lee. “By the way I
hear that you two fellows are going to have a vacation.”</p>

<p>“Right you are,” chuckled Fred. “And
maybe we’re not tickled to death about it, eh,
Bobby?”</p>

<p>“You bet!” returned Bobby happily. “But
you’re on the list too, Lee, although for that matter
you’ve been having about all the vacation you
wanted for the last two weeks.”</p>

<p>“That was the wrong kind of vacation.”</p>

<p>“Of course you’ll have to spend it here,” conjectured
Fred.</p>

<p>“I’m not so sure of that,” replied Lee. “I
was speaking to the doctor this morning and he
said he thought I’d be able to make the trip home
in two or three days from now. He thinks the
warm southern weather is just what I need to
bring me around all right again. So I telegraphed
to my mother this morning about it and asked her
to answer right away.”</p>

<p>He had barely finished speaking when there
was a knock at the door, and a messenger entered
with a telegram.</p>

<p>“Here it is now!” exclaimed Lee, his face
lighting up with expectancy. “If you fellows will
excuse me I’ll see what she says.”</p>

<p>He ran his eyes eagerly over the telegram,
which was an unusually long one, and before it
was finished gave a whoop of delight.</p>

<p>“Sounds as though you had good news,” remarked
Bobby, as he saw the flushed face and
sparkling eyes of his friend.</p>

<p>“I should say so!” cried Lee, waving the yellow
slip above his head. “Listen to this part of
it, fellows: ‘I cannot tell you how grateful I am
to the brave boys who saved your life, and I want
you to be sure to bring them along with you for a
visit, if they would care to come.’ How about it
fellows? Will you come along with me?”</p>

<p>“If we would care to come!” repeated Bobby.
“You bet we’ll come!”</p>

<p>“Will a duck swim?” asked Fred, wild with delight
at the vista opened up by the invitation.
“That is,” he added a little more soberly, “if the
folks at home will let us go.”</p>

<p>“Of course,” agreed Bobby. “But I haven’t
much doubt about that. They let us go West on
a ranch, and I don’t see why they shouldn’t be
just as willing to have us go down South on a
plantation. Come along, Fred, and we’ll write
to them now, so that the letters will get to them
to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“Why not telegraph?” asked Fred, who was
bubbling over with excitement and impatience.</p>

<p>“It would cost too much,” replied practical
Bobby. “We’ll have to write good long letters to
explain everything and get them to let us go.”</p>

<p>“Put it strong,” counseled Lee. “I’ll be terribly
disappointed if you can’t go with me. And
I know that my mother will, too. I want to show
you what life is on a real old-fashioned Southern
plantation.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you worry,” replied Bobby. “If we
can’t go, you can be sure that it won’t be any fault
of ours.”</p>

<p>They put all their powers of persuasion into the
letters they wrote, and were especially urgent that
the answers should be sent at once. Then they
waited with feverish impatience for the replies.</p>

<p>These were not long in coming, for the second
day after they wrote they received the answers.
They tore the letters open with quaking hearts,
for fear that they might prove unfavorable.
And their delight was beyond bounds when they
found that they might go. There were long letters
of advice and injunctions to take the best
care of themselves. And there was also in each
letter a substantial check to cover all expenses of
the trip. It was made plain to both that the
ready agreement to let them go was largely due
to their behavior at the time of the fire, and was
in the nature of a reward.</p>

<p>To save a great deal of unnecessary traveling,
it was arranged that the boys should go directly
from Rockledge School to New York. It was
thought best that they should go South by boat,
instead of rail, and a separate letter to Dr. Raymond
requested that he should telegraph for passage
and stateroom in advance, and make what
other arrangements might be necessary for the
trip.</p>

<p>As may be imagined, the next two days were
busy ones for the three boys. But at last all was
ready, and with a big send-off from their chums,
they took the train for New York. The journey
was a pleasant though uneventful one, and they
reached the city too late to do anything but go
directly to their stateroom on the boat.</p>

<p>The next morning, after a hearty breakfast,
they took up their position on the rail and watched
the scene of busy life on the pier. There was
great noise and animation as the last freight was
put into the hold and belated passengers hurried
down to the vessel. But at last order was
brought out of confusion and the bell rang the
signal for “All Ashore.”</p>

</div>

<div id='chIX' class='chapter'>
<h2>CHAPTER IX<br/>OFF FOR THE SOUTH</h2>

<p class='first'>Amid the jangling of engine room bells, the
hiss of escaping steam, and the hoarse cries of the
deck hands, the boat moved majestically out into
the broad river, two small but very efficient tugboats
pushed and hauled at the heavy steamer,
butting their stubby noses desperately against
her towering sides to counteract the effects of the
strong tide. Long strings of heavily loaded
barges, towed by other snorting tugs, passed up
and down stream, while numerous ferryboats
added their bit to the heavy river traffic.</p>

<p>Leaning over the rail, the three friends were
absorbed in watching this busy scene. To them
it seemed impossible that their own boat could
get safely started without colliding with any of
the swarming smaller craft. But after much
maneuvering and tooting of whistles the big
steamer finally got her nose pointing downstream
and headed slowly for the lower bay.</p>

<p>“Gee!” exclaimed Bobby, drawing a deep
breath, “I don’t understand yet how we got out
here without bumping something. I always
thought it was kind of hard to dodge eleven men
on a football field without coming to grief, but
this makes it look easy.”</p>

<p>“Well, it always did seem to be easy enough
for you, as far as that goes,” remarked Fred.
“But don’t forget we’ve got lots of chances yet
to hit something before we get to New Orleans.
The man that steers this overgrown canoe may
go to sleep and land us on some nice hard rocks,
or we may hit a floating wreck, or—”</p>

<p>“Don’t stop,” urged Lee, as Fred hesitated a
moment in search of some other ghastly possibility,
“you’ll have us really enjoying this trip
pretty soon. Somebody please tie a life preserver
on me.”</p>

<p>“Well, perhaps you’ve never been on anything
bigger than Monatook Lake, and it’s only right
that we experienced sailors should prepare you
for the worst. Of course, we may be lucky
enough to get there all right, but whatever happens,
you can’t say we didn’t warn you.”</p>

<p>“This is a nice time to warn a fellow, isn’t it?”
said Lee, with a grin, “but I’m not going to ask
the captain to stop the boat now and let me walk
ashore, so you may as well save all those cheerful
predictions for some other time.”</p>

<p>“He won’t scare worth two cents, will he?”
laughed Bobby. “But maybe when he gets his
first dose of seasickness he won’t feel so cheerful.”</p>

<p>While the boys were talking, the ship had made
steady progress, and now, passing the Statue of
Liberty, was well into the lower bay. Here the
tugs left it, and the great steamer vibrated from
stem to stern as its powerful engines took up the
task appointed them. In quick succession they
passed the Ambrose and Sandy Hook lights, and
began to feel the roll and heave of the great blue
ocean.</p>

<p>“Isn’t this great?” exclaimed Bobby. “Just
fill your lungs with that air, fellows.”</p>

<p>“The air is fine, all right,” said Fred. “But
a little something to fill my stomach wouldn’t be
so awful bad, either.”</p>

<p>“That sounds like Pee Wee,” laughed Bobby.
“But since you mention it, I begin to feel hungry
too. How about you, Lee?”</p>

<p>“You bet,” exclaimed the boy from the South,
but his voice lacked the tone of sincerity. Fred
looked at him and grinned.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter, Lee?” he inquired. “You
don’t mean to tell me you’re feeling seasick, do
you?”</p>

<p>“Of course I’m not seasick.”</p>

<p>“No, of course he isn’t seasick,” said Bobby,
with a wink at Fred. “He just doesn’t feel well,
that’s all. People are often that way on salt
water. It must be something about the air, I
guess.”</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s probably it,” agreed Fred, in a
tone of deep sympathy. “What you need, Lee,
is a good bang up supper to set you up. How
would a nice pork chop or two hit you?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know how they’d hit me, but I do
know that something is going to hit you pretty
quick, if you don’t stop talking about eats,” retorted
Lee. “You two go on down and eat your
heads off. I’m going to stay up here a while. I
had a big lunch, anyway.”</p>

<p>“Well, you probably won’t have it much
longer,” was Fred’s parting shot, as he and
Bobby started on a run for the dining room.</p>

<p>There were a number of empty places around
the tables, but Bobby and Fred enjoyed the meal
hugely, with appetites no whit affected by the
uneasy motion of the ship. When they had finished,
they went on deck again, and found Lee
coiled up in a steamer chair, and looking far from
happy.</p>

<p>“Guess I’ll have to admit that I’m seasick,”
he said, with a somewhat feeble grin, “but I’ve
got lots of company, anyway. Most everybody
I’ve seen so far seems to be as bad or worse than
I am.”</p>

<p>“Oh, well, it probably won’t last long,” said
Bobby. “If you can get a decent rest to-night,
you’ll be all right in the morning.”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t mind so much now if we did hit
some of those rocks Fred was talking about,”
went on the boy from the South. “If I could
get onto a nice solid rock right now, I know I’d
feel a whole lot better.”</p>

<p>But when the next morning came, the ocean was
very calm, and Lee felt almost himself again, so
that he could aid his two friends in their attacks
on the excellent meals that were provided for
them. They read, played deck games, and altogether
enjoyed themselves immensely. On the
second day of the trip, they noticed that the air
was becoming perceptibly warmer, and knew that
they were getting into southern waters. Schools
of porpoises raced with the ship, and the boys
never tired watching them shooting through the
water just under the ship’s bows, and keeping up
their speed without any apparent effort. Several
times they saw little flying fish, and once Fred
was sure that he saw a shark, but when the ship
came up with the object that he had seen, it
proved to be nothing more ferocious than a half
submerged log.</p>

<p>“Some sailor, you are,” said Lee, anxious to
get even with Fred for some of the remarks
passed on his own seamanship. “I may not be as
salty as some people think they are, but still I
can tell fishes from trees.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m glad you know that much, anyway,”
said Fred. “You certainly are coming along
fast. Some day, when you get over calling portholes
windows, you’ll be a real sailor.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think I ever want to be a sailor,” retorted Lee.
“Good old solid ground is good
enough for me. Seems to me this old tub is
jumping around worse all the time.”</p>

<p>“It would be strange if it didn’t,” said Bobby.
“The wind is getting stronger every minute, and
it’s working up some pretty big seas.”</p>

<p>Almost as he finished speaking a big wave
dashed against the bow, and showered them with
spray.</p>

<p>“I’m going some place where it’s dry!” gasped
the boy from the South, and dashed for the companionway.
Bobby and Fred lingered a while,
but were soon, forced to seek shelter in the lee
of a deckhouse. They could see members of the
crew going about making every movable object
fast, and they guessed that they were in for a
storm.</p>

</div>

<div id='chX' class='chapter'>
<h2>CHAPTER X<br/>HALF A GALE</h2>

<p class='first'>In an incredibly short space of time a heavy
sea was running, and the big ship, which at its
dock had seemed so solid and immovable, was
tossed about almost wholly at the will of the angry
waves. The bow would rise up and up as it met
a rushing hill of frothing green water, then, as
the giant wave rushed astern, the bow would dip,
and the whole vessel would seem to be coasting
down into a frothing valley. Crests of the big
rollers, picked up and flung aboard by the howling
wind, drenched any hardy soul who ventured
on deck. Sometimes the bow would not lift
quickly enough to an onrushing wave, and the
water would crash down on the forecastle with a
tremendous impact and rush aft, sweeping any
movable object along with it.</p>

<p>The engines were throttled down to “half
speed ahead,” which eased the laboring of the
vessel somewhat. Night fell early over a wild
and desolate waste of tossing waters, and even
the three carefree boys were sobered somewhat
as they gazed through tightly bolted portholes
at the scene without. Lee was frankly seasick
again, and even Bobby and Fred had to admit
that they “felt a little off.”</p>

<p>“But anyway, a storm like this isn’t likely to
last long,” remarked Bobby. “It came up in a
hurry, and likely will go down just as fast.”</p>

<p>“It can’t go too fast to suit me,” groaned Lee,
“‘A life on the rolling deep’ may be all right
for some people, but it rolls entirely too much to
be popular with me.”</p>

<p>“Not to mention how deep it is when the ship
happens to sink,” said Fred. “Whether we like it
or not, we’ve got to admit that the man who wrote
that poetry knew what he was talking about.”</p>

<p>“Well, it’s time for supper, and I’m going to
have some,” said Bobby. “What do you say,
fellows? Are you with me?”</p>

<p>“Guess you’ll have to count me out,” replied
the boy from the South. “I don’t think food
and I will ever be friends again.”</p>

<p>Bobby and Fred managed to satisfy their appetites,
although the dishes persisted in dodging
here and there in a most disconcerting manner,
and never seemed to be satisfied until they had
settled themselves comfortably in some one’s lap.
Most of the passengers were keeping to their
staterooms, and taken altogether, the meal was
not exactly a cheerful affair. All three of the
boys turned into their berths soon afterward, and
by dint of wedging themselves in with pillows and
rolled up articles of clothing, managed to get
a fairly good night’s rest.</p>

<p>In the morning the wind appeared to have
blown itself out, and as the boys were dressing a
weak and watery shaft of sunlight came streaming
through the porthole.</p>

<p>“That certainly looks good to me,” said Lee,
who still looked rather pale and unhappy. “If
ever I get back on dry land, I’m going to stay
there a while.”</p>

<p>“It won’t feel bad for a change,” admitted
Fred, “and with a little luck we ought to make
it in another day or two. We’d have gotten in
without this delay if it hadn’t been for the
storm.”</p>

<p>After breakfast the boys went on deck, and
found the ocean much moderated, although still
far from calm. After a little, they found themselves
near the door of the wireless room, and
were soon chatting with the operator on duty,
who seemed to be a genial sort of fellow. He and
the boys were soon on the best of terms, and he
explained the workings of some of the simpler
parts of the apparatus.</p>

<p>“I suppose a night like last night keeps you
fellows pretty busy, doesn’t it?” inquired Bobby.</p>

<p>“Yes, we have to be right on the job,” answered
Quinn, the wireless operator, “although
last night wasn’t as bad as many I’ve been
through. We didn’t get an S. 0. S. call once.”</p>

<p>“From the way this ship was acting,” said
Lee, ruefully, “I should think it would be more
likely that we would be sending a call for help
instead of receiving it.”</p>

<p>“Why, that wasn’t any more than a brisk
breeze compared to some of the blows I’ve been
through,” said Quinn. “I remember one night
on the North Sea when it really did blow some.
And as far as that goes, I’m willing to bet that
everybody else on that ship remembers it, too.”</p>

<p>“Was it so very bad, then?” inquired Bobby.</p>

<p>“Well, at that time I was doing duty on a converted
yacht. We were guarding a convoy, and
one by one the other patrol boats made for port,
being unable to stay out any longer. But our
captain refused to give up, and finally we were
the only boat left. Well, the wind kept blowing
harder and the seas rising, until the only wonder
is that we weren’t swamped altogether. Tremendous
seas were following us, and at last one
monster came right aboard over the after rail.
It slammed up against the wireless shack, and
before we knew what had happened, we and the
shack were carried bodily forward. We thought
that our last minute had come, but, luckily for
us, the wireless house was slammed up against
the forward deck house. Then it went to pieces
entirely. I made a grab for the first thing my
hand met, which happened to be a mast stay, and
hung on for all I knew how. It seemed to me
that I was under water for an age, but the big
wave finally passed, and I crawled back to the
deck more dead than alive. Yes, that was a real
rough night at sea, I’ll admit.”</p>

<p>“How about the other wireless men?” queried
Fred. “Did they come through all right?”</p>

<p>“Well, by a miracle neither was swept overboard,
but Pearsall, who had just joined the ship
a week or two before, broke his right arm. But
he considered himself lucky to be alive at all.
We all did, for that matter.”</p>

<p>“I should think you would be,” said Bobby,
“and I suppose you had plenty of other narrow
escapes besides that one.”</p>

<p>“Plenty is right,” assented Quinn, “Why, I
remember one winter afternoon we got an S.O.S.
from a munition ship that had caught fire. It
was some eighty miles to the west of us, and by the
time we reached it, it was right on the edge of
dark. When we got there, the fire was at its
height. Most of their boats had been wrecked
by the explosions of ammunition as the fire
reached it, and most of the crew were in the water,
some with life preservers, and others clinging to
bits of floating wreckage. It was like going
through a barrage to get near them. But we
lowered our boats and finally got the last man
safely aboard. Then we steamed away at a rate
the old hooker had never hit up before, because
we knew that when the fire reached the main
hold there would be a blowup that would pretty
well clean everything that happened to be around
right off the water. And we weren’t a bit too
soon either, because we hadn’t covered more than
half a mile when the blazing wreck exploded with
a slam that you could hear for fifty miles. As it
was, we were pretty well shaken up, but got off
without any serious damage. But it was pretty
ticklish business while we were cruising round
a cable’s length away, picking the crew out of
the water.”</p>

</div>

<div id='chXI' class='chapter'>
<h2>CHAPTER XI<br/>QUICK THINKING</h2>

<p class='first'>“It must have taken some nerve to do it at
all,” declared Lee admiringly.</p>

<p>“Well, we knew they’d have done the same
thing for us, if conditions had been the other way
round,” said Quinn. “If seamen didn’t help
each other out that way, the life would be even
harder than it is.”</p>

<p>The boys were eager to hear more of the wireless
man’s adventures, and he, nothing loth, spun
them more than one yarn of exciting episodes in
far corners of the earth, for he had been almost
everywhere that ships go. He was often interrupted
by messages coming or going, but the boys
were fascinated by his stories, and could hardly
tear themselves away when dinner time came.</p>

<p>“That man has surely seen a lot,” remarked
Bobby, while they were eating an excellent meal,
“and he knows how to tell about what he has
seen, too. I’m sorry we didn’t get acquainted
with him earlier on the trip.”</p>

<p>“So am I,” agreed Lee, “but he’ll be on duty
again this evening, and if we get a chance we
can look him up then.”</p>

<p>After lunch the three friends went on deck
again. The sea by this time was quite calm, and
the boys strolled over to the port side and, leaning
on the rail, gazed idly out over the broad expanse
of waters.</p>

<p>Suddenly the lads heard a shrill yell and a
heavy splash alongside the ship. One of the
mess boys, a young negro, had been sitting carelessly
on the rail not far from where the boys
were standing, when a sudden lurch of the vessel
had thrown him off his balance and he had made
a clean dive overboard.</p>

<p>For a second the boys were stunned by the
unexpectedness of the accident. Then Bobby
whipped out his jacknife, cut loose a life preserver
that Fred was trying to loosen, and tossed it to
the struggling negro in the water. He judged
his distance so accurately that the buoy landed
within a foot or two of the unfortunate darkey,
who with a desperate struggle caught hold of it.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Fred and Lee were shouting “man
overboard,” and the cry, passed from mouth to
mouth, reached the bridge. The engine room
telegraph rang “stop” and then “full speed
astern.” Almost before the big ship had come to
a shuddering standstill, a boat had been lowered,
and in short time they had the gasping darkey
boy aboard.</p>

<p>“Mah Lan’ Sakes!” he sputtered, “Ah don’t
known who-all threw me dat life p’server, but
whoevah did saved mah life, Ah reckon, an I’se
shuah enough grateful.”</p>

<p>“Well, who was it threw you the preserver,
and how in time did you come to fall overboard
and make us all this trouble?” inquired the mate,
who in his official capacity thought more of the
time lost than of the narrow escape from death
the little darkey had had.</p>

<p>“Ah cain’t say, suh, jes huccome I to fall ovahboahd,”
said the little darkey. “Seems like Ah
don’t nevah go to git me a little rest on dis yeah
ship but whut somethin’ happens. Ole ship jes
gives a roll an’ heaves me clean ovah de side.
Ah ain’t sure who give me dat life p’server, but
seems like they was three fellers standin’ by the
rail, and one of ’em done heave it out at me so
it pretty near lands plumb aroun’ mah neck.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but don’t you know who it was?” persisted
the mate.</p>

<p>“Well, suh, seems to me it was one of them,”
pointing to where Bobby, Fred and Lee were
standing, “but Ah couldn’t rightly say which
one.”</p>

<p>“Was it one of you?” inquired the mate, turning
to them.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Bobby, “I guess I’ll have to
plead guilty. We heard him splash overboard,
and luckily there was a life preserver right near
us, so I threw it over to him.”</p>

<p>“It was rather lucky for young ’Rastus here,”
commented the officer. “Your name <i>is</i> ’Rastus,
isn’t it?” addressing the little darkey.</p>

<p>“Yessuh, dat’s part of it,” returned ’Rastus,
with a grin that seemed to show every tooth he
possessed.</p>

<p>“What’s the rest of it?” inquired Bobby.</p>

<p>“Mah full name am ’Rastus Abimilech Belshazzar
Johnson,” said the little negro, evidently
taking no small pride in this pretentious title.</p>

<p>“It’s a wonder we’re still afloat with a name
like that aboard,” exclaimed Mr. Parr, the mate.
“But you’d better get down below, ’Rastus, and
get some dry clothes on.”</p>

<p>“Ah sho’ craves to git me some dry duds,”
said ’Rastus. “An’ furdermo’, ’fore Ah goes Ah
wants t’ thank, yuh, white boy, for heavin’ me
dat cork doughnut de way yuh did. Ah’d be
confabulatin’ wid de little fishes down at de
bottom of de ocean if yuh hadn’t.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s all right,” said Bobby. “Next
time you’d better be sure you’ve got a good toe-hold
before you decorate the rail.”</p>

<p>“Yessuh,” said ’Rastus, meekly, and departed
for the lower regions of the ship, leaving a wet
trail on the white deck to mark his going.</p>

<p>The crowd of passengers that had assembled
all wanted to shake hands with Bobby at once,
and were inclined to make a hero of him, but
nothing was further from that young gentleman’s
mind, and as soon as possible the three friends
made their escape.</p>

<p>“Whew!” exclaimed Bobby, mopping his face,
“you’d have thought I had really done something,
to listen to that crowd.”</p>

<p>“Well, I should say you have done something,”
chuckled Lee. “You’ve saved the longest name
I ever heard in my life from getting drowned,
haven’t you?”</p>

<p>“Well, I guess that’s right enough,” laughed
Bobby. “If I had known ’Rastus’ full name, I’d
have slung him two life preservers, for fear one
wouldn’t be able to float it.”</p>

<p>“It is a mighty big name for such a little rascal,”
said Fred, “but he seemed grateful enough,
Bobby. Maybe he’ll do you a good turn some day.
You never can tell.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII<br/>UNDER SUNNY SKIES</h2>

<p class='first'>It was early one morning that the ship warped
into her berth at New Orleans. The three
friends were up bright and early, as they knew
that the steamer would dock shortly after dawn,
and they did not want to miss any of the excitement
of the event. The big wharves were
swarming with negro stevedores, who joked and
sang good-naturedly as they shifted huge bales
of cotton and boxes containing all manner of
goods. Ships already at their docks, either
loading or unloading, sent up puffs of steam as
their cargo winches lifted huge nets full of barrels
and boxes from the seemingly inexhaustible
holds, or consigned them to the same place.
Mule teams, horse teams, and big rumbling automobile
trucks came and went, getting in each
other’s way and giving rise to short but forceful
arguments on the part of their drivers. In a
word, all the varied bustle and activity of a large
and busy port was spread out for the boys to
view from their vantage point on the upper deck.</p>

<p>On the dock for which they were heading, a
group of negro laborers was waiting for the
vessel to be made fast, and suddenly one of them
started a spirited “buck and wing” dance, the
others singing, whistling, and keeping time by
clapping their hands. As the ship crept up to
the dock at a snail’s pace, many of the passengers
crowded over to the starboard side, where
the boys were standing, and when the perspiring
dancer finally ended with a double shuffle and a
bow, he was rewarded by a shower of coins that
rained down from the side of the ship which was
now being warped up to the dock and made fast.</p>

<p>“Some pep to that boy,” commented Fred.
“You’d think they’d save their energy for the
work ahead of them.”</p>

<p>“Oh, a negro always has time and energy for
a little fun, no matter how hard he has to work,”
replied Lee. “I’ve seen them dancing and cutting
up after a long day of cotton picking, and
that’s about as hard work as I know anything
about.”</p>

<p>But there was no longer much time to spend
on the deck, for now the gangplank had been shot
out and the passengers were beginning to stream
over it. This reminded the boys that they also
had some strapping and bundling to do, and they
rushed to their stateroom and got to work. In
a few minutes all their packing had been done,
and with warm good-bys to the officers and many
of the passengers, with whom they had become
favorites, they left the steamer.</p>

<p>“Seems like an old friend, already,” commented
Bobby, as they walked along the pier.
“I don’t wonder that sailors fall in love with
their ships.”</p>

<p>“I suppose any place begins to seem like home
after you’ve been there for a while,” replied
Fred. “But as for me give me terra cotta every
time.”</p>

<p>“Terra firma I suppose you mean,” laughed
Lee.</p>

<p>“Let it go at that,” said Fred carelessly.
“What’s one word more or less between friends?”</p>

<p>A stalwart young negro was lying on a bale of
cotton, basking like a cat in the hot sun. The
leader of a gang of roustabouts came hurrying
along looking for men.</p>

<p>“Got a job for you, Sam,” he said. “This
steamer’s got to be unloaded in a hurry. Come
along now and I’ll put you in a gang.”</p>

<p>“Nothin’ doin, boss,” replied the negro with a
yawn.</p>

<p>“Why, what’s the matter with you?” remonstrated
his would be employer. “It was only
yesterday you were striking me for a job.”</p>

<p>“Ya-as,” replied the other, as he yawned and
turned over for another nap, “but dat war yesterday.
Ah made two bits dis mornin’, an now
Ah got money in mah pocket. Go ’way, man, an’
let me sleep.”</p>

<p>With a gesture of disgust the other hurried
away to look for more likely material. The boys
looked at each other and laughed.</p>

<p>“You see from that what we’re up against
down here,” said Lee. “That’s the way most of
them are. As long as they have money enough
for their next meal, they’re perfectly satisfied.
That man with a few cents in his pockets is as
happy as if he were a millionaire.”</p>

<p>They had about two hours before it was time
for their train to start, and as it was nearly noon,
the first thing they did was to get a hearty meal.
Then they spent a little while roaming about the
beautiful and busy city, so different in many respects
from what Bobby and Fred bad been accustomed
to in the North. They were especially
interested in viewing the spot where, behind cotton
bales, Andrew Jackson and his men had held
off the flower of the British Army and won the
most notable victory of the war of 1812.</p>

<p>“It was great,” said Bobby, as he looked at
his watch. “But hurry up, fellows. We’ll have
to get a hustle on, or we’ll miss the train.”</p>

<p>But Lee did not seem especially alarmed.</p>

<p>“I guess we’ll have time enough,” he said.
“The train we’re going to take doesn’t bother
much about timetables. Still there’s no use in
taking chances.”</p>

<p>His conjecture was correct, for although they
got to the station on time, it was some time after
the scheduled hour when the wheezy old engine
pulled out of the depot. And after it got started
it rambled on in a careless, happy-go-lucky way,
as though it did not care much when it got to its
destination.</p>

<p>It was a mixed freight and passenger train.
There were perhaps a dozen freight cars, with
one passenger coach attached to the end of the
train. It ran along a single track, which was little
more than “two streaks of rust and a right of
way.”</p>

<p>Most of the stations at which the train stopped
were small ones, but there were one or two of
respectable size. When the train came to a halt
at these, there were usually several negro women
who walked along the side of the passenger
car, offering their wares to the travelers. Their
chief stock in trade was fried chicken, and this
smelled so good that the boys bought repeatedly,
until Fred at last declared that he’d be ashamed
after that to look a chicken in the face.</p>

<p>“You want to save room, fellows,” remonstrated
Lee. “My mother will have a corking
good supper waiting for us, and she’ll want to
see you put it away.”</p>

<p>“She needn’t worry a bit about that,” mumbled
Fred, with his mouth full. “We may have our
faults, but we never go back on grub. Just put
us at the table and trust us to do the rest.”</p>

<p>Both Bobby and Fred were impressed by the
leisurely way in which life seemed to flow on in
the various places through which they passed.
Even the soft haze in the atmosphere was suggestive
of rest and quiet. In the little towns, dogs
lay in the dust in the middle of the road, not at
all disturbed by the fear of being run over. Merchants
in their shirt sleeves sat in front of their
stores, with chairs tilted back, exchanging gossip
with farmers, who had come in with their produce
and were in no hurry to get back. Even
the people coming toward the station to take the
train sauntered along with no fear of being left.
Some of them stopped to chat with the engineer,
who leaned against the side of his cab, chewing
a straw and showing in every movement that
time was the last thing in the world that could
bother him. Then after a while he would get up
in his seat, and the train would begin to move,
with much wheezing and creaking, as though disgruntled
at being disturbed.</p>

<p>“Any mattresses on the train?” queried Fred,
as he looked around him. “Looks as if we’d
spend the night here, at the rate we’re going.”</p>

<p>“Not quite so bad as that,” laughed Lee,
“though I don’t wonder that you think so. But
we’ve only two more stations now before we
come to Raneleigh. That’s the nearest station
to the plantation.”</p>

<p>“Do we have far to walk to get to your place?”
asked Fred, as he viewed their collection of suit
cases rather apprehensively.</p>

<p>“Oh, we’re about six miles from the station,”
rejoined Lee carelessly.</p>

<p>“Six miles,” gasped Fred. “Scubbity-yow!
And on a hot day like this. I can see where I
melt into a grease spot.”</p>

<p>“Hold your horses,” said Lee. “You won’t
have to walk a step. One of the men will be at
the station with a buckboard and a pair of mules.
Ever ridden in a buckboard?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Fred, “many a time out on the
ranch. But I’ve never ridden behind mules. Do
they step fast?”</p>

<p>“Not that you could notice,” grinned Lee.
“Their strong point is in standing fast. Once
in a while we have to build a fire under one of
them to get it to budge. You’ll know a good
sight more about mules than you do now when
you go back to school.”</p>

<p>“School!” groaned Fred. “What’s the use
of spoiling a perfectly good day by talking about
school. We’ll have to go back soon enough.
Let’s forget it while we’re here.”</p>

<p>In less than an hour they were approaching
Raneleigh, and Bobby and Fred craned their
necks in order to get a glimpse of the town. All
they saw however as the train lumbered up to
the platform was a general store, that stood opposite
the station, and three or four dwellings
located irregularly along a dusty street.</p>

<p>“As a matter of fact it isn’t a town at all, only
a station,” explained Lee, as he led the way out
on the platform. “Ah, there’s Jim!” he exclaimed,
as a rather decrepit old negro came hobbling
up to meet them. “How are you, Jim?”</p>

<p>“Tol’able, jess tol’able, Marse Lee,” replied
Jim. “Ah sho’ am glad to see you-all.”</p>

<p>“These are my friends, Bobby Blake and Fred
Martin,” said Lee, as he piled the bags in the
back of the buckboard. “They’ve come down
to stay awhile with me on the plantation.”</p>

<p>The old man took off his tattered hat and made
a sweeping bow.</p>

<p>“I’se proud to meet de young gem’lum,” he
said. “Missus tole me dey waz a comin’. We
sho’ will try ter give dem er mighty good time.”</p>

</div>

<div id='chXIII' class='chapter'>
<h2>CHAPTER XIII<br/>FLYING HEELS</h2>

<p class='first'>The six dusty miles from the station to the
plantation would have been tedious ordinarily,
but the boys were too full of high spirits to let
little things like dust and heat affect them. The
buckboard creaked and jounced along, and the
mules seemed to have even more than their share
of the general disinclination to hurry. The old
negro gave the boys news of all that had been
going on at the plantation since Lee’s last time
home.</p>

<p>“Ah’m afraid dat Marse Jim Boolus am fixin’
to make you an’ you ma all de trouble dat he
kin,” said the old darkey, shaking his head.
“Seems like he’s gettin’ meaner and more no-account
every year dat passes over his haid.”</p>

<p>“The old rascal!” exclaimed Lee, with flashing
eyes. “I’ll make him sorry some day for all
the trouble he’s caused my family.”</p>

<p>“Dere’s lots of odder folks feels de same way,”
said Jim. “Ev’body in de parish hates him like
pisen, but de more people hates him de mo’ he
seems to like it.”</p>

<p>On the boat Lee had said quite a little of this
Jim Boolus to Bobby and Fred. He was a mean
old skinflint, who had thriven on the misery of
others, and by many a shady deal had brought
ruin on honest people. While everybody knew
him to be unscrupulous and dishonest, he was so
cunning and crafty that he always managed to
keep out of the grip of the law. At present he
was trying to prove his ownership to a large part
of Mrs. Cartier’s estate, and she was in serious
danger of losing it.</p>

<p>The boys were still discussing ways and means
to frustrate the wily schemings of the crafty old
land shark when the buckboard turned off the
dusty road, pursued its leisurely way up a long
graveled avenue shaded by stately trees, and drew
up before a wide-flung old mansion flanked by
wide verandas. Before it had stopped Lee
jumped out and ran to meet a pleasant faced
lady who was descending the steps. After their
first affectionate greeting Lee introduced Bobby
and Fred to her.</p>

<p>“These are my two friends, Mother, Bobby
Blake and Fred Martin,” he said. “I guess
you’ve heard so much about them in my letters
to you that you hardly need an introduction.”</p>

<p>“Indeed yes,” she smiled. “And I hope that
Lee’s mother will be just as good friends with
you as Lee is.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Cartier was so gracious and hospitable
that the boys were quickly at their ease and felt
as though they had known her a long time.</p>

<p>Lee showed them their room, a beautiful large
one with big, comfortable looking beds and dark,
cool curtains at the windows.</p>

<p>“When you fellows have gotten some of the
dust off you, come on down and I’ll show you
around,” said Lee, as he left them.</p>

<p>“Well,” remarked Bobby, when he and Fred
were alone, “it looks to me as though we had
come to a pretty fine place to spend our vacation.
Mrs. Cartier certainly has a way of making a
fellow feel welcome.”</p>

<p>“She certainly has,” returned Fred, “I’ve
often heard about Southern hospitality, and now
I know what it’s like.”</p>

<p>“I wish we could do something to fix that skinflint
old neighbor of theirs,” continued Fred,
after a pause.</p>

<p>“Well, there’s no telling; maybe we can,” said
Bobby.</p>

<p>Shortly afterwards Bobby and Fred went downstairs,
and found Lee waiting for them on the
veranda.</p>

<p>“I thought you fellows must have been overcome
by the excitement of that buckboard
ride and dropped asleep,” grinned Lee. “You
never used to take as long as that to get spruced
up back at school, especially when you happened
to get up late and thought you’d be late for
breakfast.”</p>

<p>“When in Rome do as the Romans do,” quoted
Bobby. “When you hit a place where everybody
seems to take things easy, why be in a hurry?”</p>

<p>“Hurray!” shouted Lee. “I can see that
you’ve got the making of a Southern gentleman
in you, all right. ‘Never be in a hurry’ is one of
the first things you learn around here.”</p>

<p>“That’s all right, sometimes,” put in Fred.
“But when you’re toting a football down a field
with the goal posts looking to be about ten miles
away, and eleven fellows doing their best to grab
you around the knees and sit on your chest,
hurrying is the one thing you’re most anxious to
do.”</p>

<p>“Right!” laughed Bobby. “Not to mention the
way the coach feels about it.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll have to admit that a coach <i>doesn’t</i>
believe in taking things easy,” said Lee, “but
then, I guess probably most coaches don’t come
from the South.”</p>

<p>The others agreed that this was very probable,
and then set out on a tour of the plantation.
This covered several hundred acres, and in the
days “before the war” had evidently been a profitable
estate. Besides the big, rambling old
mansion, there were numerous barns and outbuildings,
including what had formerly been
quarters for numerous slaves. Most of these
buildings were unused and out of repair now, and,
except in the busy planting and picking seasons,
there were only five old servants on the place.
Aunt Dinah, the cook, deserved first place, because
she was past master (or mistress) of the art of
cookery, and could turn out dishes that had spread
her fame for miles in a country of good cooks.</p>

<p>Uncle Josh, a faithful old darkey, whose
wrinkled face was framed in snow white hair,
acted as “handy man” and did odd jobs where-ever
they were needed, although forever complaining
about a mysterious ailment that he invariably
referred to as “de misery in mah back.”
There were three other more or less lazy but entirely
good-natured darkeys, who did whatever
else was necessary in a carefree but somewhat
inefficient manner.</p>

<p>“They mean well enough, and they think the
world of mother and me, but unless somebody’s
watching them they’ll never hurt themselves with
overwork,” explained Lee. “When I’m through
school and college and can take charge of this
place, I’m going to get more action or know the
reason why.”</p>

<p>He took Bobby and Fred through the big barn,
where now only a few horses and mules were
stabled, although there was room for a hundred.
As they passed one stall, there was a flash of
vicious hoofs, which narrowly missed Fred, who
was the nearest.</p>

<p>“Wow!” he exclaimed, as he jumped back, “I
pretty near stopped something that time. That
beast must have a grudge against me, I guess.”</p>

<p>“Oh, it isn’t against you, in particular,” said
Lee. “He’s got a grudge against the whole
human race. That’s old Baldy, and I really
believe he’s the meanest mule that ever lived,
and if you know anything about mules, you’ll
realize that that’s saying something. I should
have warned you about him, but I didn’t think
about it.”</p>

<p>“Oh, well it doesn’t matter as long as he missed
me,” said Fred. “You can bet I’ll watch out for
him in the future.”</p>

<p>“It’s a circus to see the darkeys when they have
to harness him,” said Lee. “They’re all afraid
of him, and yet they respect him, too, because
he’s as strong as two ordinary mules, and when he
feels like it can do a hard day’s work. I think
they’re going to hitch him up in a little while,
and if you like we’ll hang around and watch the
fun.”</p>

<p>You can be sure Bobby and Fred had no objection
to this, and sure enough, in a little while
two husky colored men appeared and took down
the necessary harness from pegs on the wall.</p>

<p>“Are you going to hitch up old Baldy?” asked
Lee.</p>

<p>“We aim to, Marse Lee,” said one, whose
first name was Mose, and whose last name nobody
ever seemed to have heard. “But dat mule doan
always calculate to do jest whut we wants him to.”</p>

<p>“’Deed he don’t,” agreed the other. “Las’
time Ah come near him, he done took de seat outen
my pants, an Ah shore thought Ah was headed
straight for Kingdom Come ’fore Ah could get
away from him.”</p>

<p>The negro who had spoken first approached the
stall cautiously, but the mule heard him coming,
and, with ears laid viciously back, lashed out
at him with flying heels. But the negro was on
his guard, and jumped to one side barely in time
to save himself.</p>

<p>“Reckon ole Baldy ain’t feelin’ friendly toward
me to-day no-how,” said Mose, with a somewhat
nervous grin. “Reckon Ah’d better untie
him from de stall nex’ door.”</p>

<p>He went cautiously into the stall adjoining that
of old Baldy, and reached over gingerly to untie
his halter. But the mule was not to be caught
napping, and he made a wicked nip at the negro’s
hand. He just missed the hand, but caught the
ragged coat sleeve in his white teeth, and tore a
long strip from it.</p>

<p>“Mah goodness!” exclaimed the negro, “Ah’d
rather monkey wid a load o’ dynamite dan wid
dat mule.”</p>

<p>“Try it again, an’ I’ll take his mind offen you,”
said the other negro.</p>

<p>He picked up a long rake from a corner, and
with this began prodding at the rear end of the
mule, while his companion again cautiously approached
the halter. This ruse was successful,
for the animal was so occupied with trying to
kick the rake handle into bits, that he hardly
noticed anything else, and Mose had no trouble
this time in untying the halter.</p>

<p>“Watch out dare, niggah!” he admonished his
assistant. “Everybody git out of de way an’ let
this critter sail.”</p>

<p>The boys scattered to places of safety, as the
mule, finding his head free, backed out of the
stall and made for the open door. There was
a fenced-in yard surrounding the stable, and he
galloped around this, kicking up his heels and
hee-hawing. The two negroes dashed pellmell
after him, followed by the laughing boys.</p>

<p>“Now the real fun will begin,” said Lee. “Just
watch them try to harness him up.”</p>

</div>

<div id='chXIV' class='chapter'>
<h2>CHAPTER XIV<br/>BALDY GIVES IN</h2>

<p class='first'>The two darkeys had their blood up now, and
were resolved to get that mule harnessed or die
in the attempt. Mose had the big padded collar,
and his companion had the bridle. They crept
up warily toward old Baldy, who, with the wisdom
born of many such encounters, refused to be cornered,
dashing out with surprising speed every
time things began to look bad for him. But at
last the negroes maneuvered him into a corner
from which there was no escape, and then, with a
sudden rush, threw themselves at him. Mose
caught him round the neck, while the other leaped
to his back and clung there with hands and knees.
They were wise in the ways of mules, also, and
enjoyed a tussle like this, although their enjoyment
was tempered by a wholesome respect for
the kicking and biting ability of the animal.</p>

<p>But before they could get the collar over his
head, Baldy rushed across the yard kicking and
rearing, dragging the two negroes after him as
though their weight amounted to nothing at all.
The negroes held on gamely, though, and at last
the mule, despairing of shaking them off, suddenly
threw himself down and rolled completely over.
The darkeys however had anticipated some such
action, and let go just in the nick of time to save
themselves.</p>

<p>“That was a narrow escape,” said Bobby, somewhat
anxiously. “Aren’t you afraid they’ll get
hurt, Lee?”</p>

<p>“I don’t think so,” he answered. “It takes a
lot to hurt them, and they’ve done this many
times before. Just leave it to them.”</p>

<p>The mule struggled to his feet with his tormentors
clinging to him. Suddenly he gave a lightning-like
whirl that shook Mose loose in spite of
all he could do, and before he could recover himself
Baldy had lashed out and caught the darkey
fair and square. Fortunately for Mose, he still
had hold of the big padded collar, and the mule’s
hoofs landed on this with a smart whack. Mose
was propelled along several feet, and then, losing
his balance, rolled over and over in the dust.</p>

<p>The three boys thought he was badly hurt, and
rushed out to his rescue, but before they had
gone ten feet the negro had bounded to his feet,
just in time to avoid the mule, who was rushing
toward him with mouth wide open and wicked
teeth gleaming. Temporarily the fight had
been knocked out of Mose, and he fled ignominiously
for the fence, with old Baldy in hot pursuit.
With the other negro clinging desperately
around his neck, it was a ludicrous spectacle, and
as Mose cleared the fence in a wild scramble with
the mule not ten feet behind him, the boys shouted
with laughter.</p>

<p>“That was a close shave!” gasped Fred at
last. “Old Baldy is out after dark meat to-day,
I can see that.”</p>

<p>“Looks to me as though the mule had won the
decision,” said Bobby. “How about it, Lee?”</p>

<p>“Oh, they can’t give up now,” said Lee. “That
mule would never be worth a cent to us again if
they let him win. But I’m going to see if a little
strategy won’t help them out.”</p>

<p>“You two wait a minute,” he called to the
negroes, who were by now both on the safe side
of the fence, mopping at their streaming faces,
and started on a run for the barn. He soon
emerged, carrying a heaped measure with oats.
Baldy was at the other end of the yard, watching
proceedings with deep suspicion. Lee emptied
the oats on the ground within two feet of the
fence, and then rejoined his friends.</p>

<p>“You two wait until he starts to eat the oats,
and then jump on him,” he shouted to the negroes.</p>

<p>“Yessah,” responded Mose, with a grin.
“’Clare to goodness, Ah’d clean forgot dat you
can ketch more flies wid honey dan yuh can wid
vinegar.”</p>

<p>When Baldy saw the tempting heap of oats,
it occurred to him that a little something to eat
wouldn’t be so bad, and he sidled over to them
and began eating. The darkeys secured the harness
that they had been forced to drop, and crept
cautiously up on the mule, who was now thinking
only of how delicious oats could taste to a hungry
mule. Mose mounted the fence just back of
old Baldy, while his companion crept close to the
mule’s other side. Suddenly Mose leaped
squarely on his back. With a frightened snort
the mule jerked his head up, and at that second
Mose slipped the heavy collar over his neck. At
the same moment the other negro slipped the
bridle over his head, forced the bit into his mouth,
and before he could flick his tail old Baldy found
himself arrayed in harness. The suddenness of
the attack seemed to take all the spirit out of the
mule, and when he found himself actually harnessed
he submitted with only a few feeble kicks
and bucks as protest against the trick that had
been played on him. He was soon hitched to the
wagon, and it rattled out of the yard with the two
colored men on the seat laughing and throwing
insults at the subdued Baldy.</p>

<p>“That was some inspiration you had, Lee,”
said Bobby. “I thought at one time you’d have to
call in the police if you wanted to get him harnessed.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s an old trick,” said the Southern lad.
“I’ve seen those same darkeys do the same thing,
but I guess this time they were so rattled they
didn’t think of it.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m glad they didn’t do that at the beginning,”
said Fred. “We’d have missed a lot of
fun if they had. I don’t think I’ll ever forget
how funny Mose looked streaking for the fence
with that mule snapping his teeth right behind
him.”</p>

<p>“Yes, old Mose was a scared darkey, all right,”
laughed Lee. “But now, I don’t know about you
fellows, but I for one am beginning to feel as
though I could appreciate some of Aunt Dinah’s
cooking.”</p>

<p>“Well, suppose you lead us to it and let us
show you how we feel about it,” said Bobby.
“As they often remind us in school, it’s deeds that
count, not words.”</p>

<p>“All right, then, just follow me and I’ll give
you a chance to demonstrate,” said Lee.</p>

<p>“Lead on,” said Fred, “and remember that
we’re with you to the last doughnut.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I know I can count on you,” returned
Lee, as he and his friends headed for the house.
“But I know you can’t eat too much to suit Aunt
Dinah. The more you pack away, the more she
thinks you like her cooking. She is sure an artist
when, it comes to performing on a cook stove.”</p>

<p>Arrived at the house, the boys found that Lee’s
praise of Aunt Dinah’s abilities had been well
founded. Creamy, luscious biscuits, tender,
juicy fried chicken, with various tempting side
dishes, were topped off by an apple pie that Fred
later referred to as “a dream,” and when they
finally adjourned to the spacious veranda they
felt at peace with all the world.</p>

<p>“Why, I feel so good I think I could even forgive
Ap Plunkit for soaking me with a baseball,
the way he did last season,” said Fred.</p>

<p>“Well, Lee, if you ever had a grudge against
Fred, now’s the time to hit him,” said Bobby.
“He wouldn’t even try to hit you back. He’d
just shake hands with you and forgive you.”</p>

<p>“I’d advise <i>you</i> to try it,” said Lee, scornfully.
“I know it always takes an awful lot to
make Fred mad, but still, I’m not going to chance
it.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Cartier, who was an interested listener,
laughed. “That’s all that boys seem to think of—eating
and fighting,” she said. “Sometimes I
wonder how they ever get time to study.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Bobby, “at school, especially,
there always seems to be some one who’ll bully
everybody else, if he gets the chance, and so once
in a while we just have to show him that he
can’t.”</p>

<p>“I suppose so,” she said. “The world always
seems to have plenty of trouble makers.”</p>

</div>

<div id='chXV' class='chapter'>
<h2>CHAPTER XV<br/>THE LAND SHARK</h2>

<p class='first'>“Like Jim Boolus, for instance,” said Lee, his
face clouding over. “What is he up to now,
Mother? Has he been trying to make trouble
again?”</p>

<p>“He’s always trying to do that,” responded
Mrs. Cartier, “and the worst of it is, he so often
succeeds.”</p>

<p>“Lee was telling us something about him,”
said Bobby, “but I’m afraid Fred and I don’t
understand it very well, anyway.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Mrs. Cartier, “our family has
owned this plantation over a hundred years, and
until recently there was no question of our ownership.
But now, this Jim Boolus has laid claim
to all the southern half of our land, and while we
and all our neighbors are morally certain that
his claim is dishonest, we find it a difficult thing
to prove according to law.”</p>

<p>“You see,” explained Lee, “when my great-grandfather
bought this land it was wild country,
nothing but woods and swamps. He had it surveyed
at that time, and the four corners were
marked off by four large stones. When he bought
the land, the southern end included a small part
of the big swamp, or Shadow Swamp, as it is
known in this neighborhood. The first Cartier,
by means of hard work and at great expense,
managed to drain the part of the swamp included
in his land, and it was on this reclaimed land that
the boundary stones were set up. For many
years this was one of the most fertile parts of the
plantation, but then came the war, and while that
was going on the swamp crept up on the drained
land and swallowed it up, and with it the boundary
stones that would, I believe, prove our ownership.”</p>

<p>“But couldn’t the swamp be drained again?”
asked Bobby. “If it were, maybe the stones
could be located again.”</p>

<p>“No,” said Lee, shaking his head doubtfully,
“the chances are the stones would have sunk below
the surface of the ground by now, and anyway,
it would cost so much to drain it now that
it would be out of the question for us.”</p>

<p>“Is it such a big swamp, Lee?” inquired Fred.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, it covers a good many miles. For
the most part, nobody can get through it at all,
but there are one or two secret paths through it,
and I’ve been told that there are small bits of
dry ground, too, if you know where to find them.
Some of the negroes around here know their way
through, and before the war runaway slaves used
to hide there sometimes. But any one who didn’t
know the place would probably get lost and swallowed
up before he’d fairly got into it.”</p>

<p>“Sounds inviting, all right,” said Fred.
“The more I hear about it, the more I think it
would be a good adventure to explore it.”</p>

<p>“You wouldn’t say that if you were as familiar
with the place as we people around here are,”
said Mrs. Cartier, shaking her head. “Two sons
of a neighbor of ours were lost in it two or three
years ago, not to mention many others.”</p>

<p>Fred said no more at that time, but Bobby,
who was nearest him thought he heard him mutter
something about “better luck next time.”</p>

<p>“But you were telling us something about a
river that ran near the plantation, weren’t you?”
asked Bobby. “Whereabouts does that lie?”</p>

<p>“Well, it’s that river that really makes the
swamp, in a way,” explained Lee. “The
country is rather low hereabouts, anyway, and
when the river hits the swamp it spreads out.
You can follow its course right through, though,
and come out on the other side, if you don’t happen
to get pocketed in some blind bayou or lagoon.”</p>

<p>“Well, perhaps we could do some exploring
by water, anyway,” suggested Fred, hopefully.</p>

<p>“That is possible,” said Mrs. Cartier. “We
have a small motor boat, and any time you boys
care to use it you may have it.”</p>

<p>“That will be fine!” exclaimed Bobby and
Fred.</p>

<p>“We can go to-morrow afternoon, if you want,”
said Lee. “I want to drive to the village in the
morning to get some things for mother, but if we
start early, we can get back in time to get the
boat and go for a short trip, anyway.”</p>

<p>Both Bobby and Fred were enthusiastic at the
prospect, and for the rest of the evening little
else was talked of except plans for the coming
outing.</p>

<p>It was arranged that Bobby should accompany
Lee on his trip to the village, while Fred was to
stay at home and look over the motor boat to
make sure that everything was in readiness to
start when his two friends got back. After making
these arrangements, the boys said good-night to
Mrs. Cartier, and went to their rooms. They
were all three excited at the prospect of fun and
adventure the next day.</p>

</div>

<div id='chXVI' class='chapter'>
<h2>CHAPTER XVI<br/>JIM BOOLUS APPEARS</h2>

<p class='first'>The three boys slept the deep and dreamless
sleep of healthy boyhood, and only woke when the
sun was streaming in at their windows.</p>

<p>“What do you know about that?” said Fred,
as he leaped out of bed and started dressing in a
wild attempt to overcome lost time. “We were
going to get an early start, and here it is nearly
eight o’clock and we’re just getting up.”</p>

<p>“Well, Lee said they never had breakfast before
eight or half past,” said Bobby, “so probably
if we hurry we’ll be all right anyway.
There’s no use our rushing ourselves when nobody
else does.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but that motor boat may need some fixing,”
said Fred. “Motor boats almost always
do, as far as I can see.”</p>

<p>“Mrs. Cartier said that this boat was in perfect
order,” Bobby reminded him.</p>

<p>“There never was a motor boat that was in
perfect order,” retorted Fred. “At least, that’s
what I heard my uncle tell my father, and he’s
had so many of them he ought to know by this
time.”</p>

<p>“You don’t seem very hopeful about it,” said
Bobby, laughing. “But here I am dressed before
you, even though you started first. That
proves that it doesn’t pay to get excited.”</p>

<p>“Well, I never did anything yet that did pay,”
declared Fred. “The only kind of things I seem
to know how to do are the things that <i>cost</i> money.”</p>

<p>“Aw, come on and have breakfast,” said
Bobby, “maybe you’ll feel better then.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m willing to find out, anyway,”
grinned Fred, and the two sallied forth in the
direction of the breakfast room. At the head of
the stairs they almost bumped into Lee as he
came tearing around a corner.</p>

<p>“Confound it!” exclaimed the Southern lad,
“I’ve pretty near killed myself hurrying, thinking
that you fellows would be all through breakfast,
by this time, and here you are just going
down.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Bobby, slyly, “if we stay here
much longer, we’ll be just as lazy as the other
people in this part of the world.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see how either one of you could get
any lazier than you always have been,” laughed
Lee.</p>

<p>“I’m not too lazy to beat you downstairs, anyway,”
said Bobby, and as Lee instantly accepted
the challenge by starting downstairs three steps
at a time, they made a tremendous racket which
brought Mrs. Cartier to the door of the breakfast
room in alarm.</p>

<p>“Good gracious!” she exclaimed, as the boys
jumped the last six steps together and landed in
a heap at the bottom. “Did you fall? Is any one
hurt?”</p>

<p>“I guess nobody’s hurt,” gasped Lee, as the
laughing boys picked themselves up. “We were
just trying to see who could get down first. You
saw the finish, Mother—tell us who won. We’ll
leave it to you.”</p>

<p>“I should say it was a tie,” she laughed, greatly
relieved. “It looked to me as though you all
landed in a heap at the same time. Bobby seemed
to be on top, so probably he won.”</p>

<p>“Well, we’ll let it go at that,” grinned her son.
“I wonder what Aunt Dinah has fixed us up for
breakfast.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps you’d better go in and see,” answered
his mother, and the boys were not slow
in following her advice. The old Southern
mammy had provided in her usual bounteous
manner, but the boys were in too much of a hurry
to properly appreciate all the good things spread
out before them. Even Lee hurried, with the result
that in a very short time they found themselves
out at the barn, where Mose had a horse
already harnessed.</p>

<p>“We’ll make the best time we can, and get
back early,” promised Lee, as he and Bobby
climbed into the buggy.</p>

<p>“All right, I’ll be waiting for you,” responded
Fred, and his two friends dashed out of the yard,
upsetting the dignity of numerous hens, who
flapped wildly to right and left, squawking their
protests.</p>

<p>“Now, if you’ll show me the motor boat, Mose,”
said Fred. “I’ll look it over and make sure
everything is all right.”</p>

<p>“Yassuh,” said the darkey, “it’s a goodish
piece from here, but Ah reckons us kin walk it
in fifteen minutes.”</p>

<p>“Guess I can stand it if you can,” said Fred,
and they started out.</p>

<p>Meantime, Lee and Bobby had reached the
dusty highroad and were going along at a spanking
pace. Their horse had been in pasture several
days with nothing to do, and seemed to enjoy
a good run with nothing but the light buggy
behind him.</p>

<p>“If we can keep this up, it won’t take us long,”
observed Bobby.</p>

<p>“Yes, but we can’t,” said Lee. “There is some
pretty sandy going before we hit town, and that
will slow old Jerry down.”</p>

<p>They soon reached a bad stretch of sandy road,
which was so narrow that there was no more than
room enough for one carriage. When two met,
each had to pull partly off the road in order to
pass, and this happened once or twice, the drivers
of the other outfits recognizing Lee and greeting
him pleasantly.</p>

<p>After passing the last rig, they had gone perhaps
half a mile, old Jerry stopping at frequent
intervals to rest, when they saw another buggy
approaching them. As it drew nearer, Lee gave
an exclamation.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” inquired Bobby. “Anything
wrong?”</p>

<p>Lee’s face was flushed as he pointed to the oncoming
buggy.</p>

<p>“There comes the meanest man in the world,”
he exclaimed, his voice shaking. “That’s Jim
Boolus, the fellow that’s trying to steal our
land.”</p>

<p>The buggies were quite close together by this
time, and the man in the other one evidently
overheard Lee’s last words. He was a lean, dyspeptic
looking old fellow, and the look of hatred
and rage that his face now wore did little to improve
his appearance.</p>

<p>“You’d better be keerful, young feller,” he
snarled, as the buggies came close, “there’s a law
in the land for them as uses hard words.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and there’s a law for people who try to
steal what doesn’t belong to them, too,” retorted
Lee. “Pull out there and let us pass, please.”</p>

</div>

<div id='chXVII' class='chapter'>
<h2>CHAPTER XVII<br/>THE RUNAWAY HORSE</h2>

<p class='first'>“Pull out yourselves, consarn ye!” shouted
Jim Boolus, his face purple with rage. Then,
seeing that Lee made no move, he suddenly
snatched his whip from its socket, and made a
savage cut at Lee’s horse.</p>

<p>Old Jerry reared and would have bolted forward,
had not Lee held him quiet with all the
strength he possessed. Bobby was infuriated by
Boolus’ cruel action, and in a second he was out
of the buggy and was leading the old miser’s
horse off the road. With a yelp of rage Boolus
made a cut at him with his whip, but Bobby
dodged just in time, and the stinging lash landed
on Boolus’ horse instead. The unfortunate animal,
already greatly excited by the altercation,
gave a leap to one side, cramping the front
wheels against the buggy. The light rig careened
over, and then, as the horse started forward
at top speed, it turned over completely, rolling
Boolus out into the deep sand at the roadside.
The frightened horse dragged the overturned
buggy a short distance, but then his harness
broke, and he streaked down the road in a
cloud of dust and sand, leaving the wrecked buggy
lying on its side.</p>

<p>Jim Boolus staggered to his feet and gazed after
his fast disappearing horse for an instant,
then turned toward the boys. For a moment they
were bewildered at the sudden development of
events, but when they saw that Boolus was unhurt
the comic side of it struck them both at the
same time, and they shouted with laughter. But
their discomfitted enemy failed to see any humor
in the situation.</p>

<p>“I’ll sue ye for this, see if I don’t!” he yelled,
dancing about in his rage. “You’ll pay for that
buggy, or I’ll know the reason why.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see where I come in,” said Lee. “You
hit your own horse and he ran away. Both of us
saw you do it, and we could swear to it in court.
You don’t suppose any one around here would
believe you if you tried to tell them anything else,
do you?”</p>

<p>Boolus glared at the boys, but the truth of what
Lee said was so evident that he could think of no
suitable retort.</p>

<p>“And now,” continued Lee, “I and my friend
here wish you a very pleasant walk to wherever
it is you were going,” and with these words he
spoke to Jerry, who started off. As they looked
back the boys could see the old skinflint still standing
in the road shaking his fists at them, until a
sudden turn hid him from view.</p>

<p>“Well, that’s one time Mr. Jim Boolus got the
worst of it,” said Bobby, wiping the tears of
mirth from his eyes. “The look on his face as he
picked himself out of that sand heap was worth
going a long way to see.”</p>

<p>“It surely was,” agreed Lee, “but I’m rather
sorry it happened just the same. He’ll hate us
worse than ever now, and he won’t stop at anything
to get even.”</p>

<p>“Well, don’t worry about it,” advised Bobby.
“Anyway, he got the worst of it this time, so
maybe he will again.”</p>

<p>“Well, I hope so,” said Lee. “He always
does the meanest thing he can think of, anyway,
so probably this won’t make much difference.”</p>

<p>They reached the village without further adventure.
Lee carried out the commission his
mother had given him, and they started back immediately.</p>

<p>“We’re late as it is, on account of that ruction
with Boolus,” said Lee. “Fred will think we’ve
gotten lost, sure.”</p>

<p>“I guess when we tell him what delayed us he
won’t mind very much,” said Bobby, with a
twinkle in his eye. “He’ll never get over being
sorry that he wasn’t with us when it happened.”</p>

<p>They passed the wrecked buggy lying in the
same position, but there was no sign of its owner,
and the boys concluded that some one had probably
come along and given him a lift. When they
reached the plantation, they found Fred waiting
for them at the gate.</p>

<p>“I thought you would be here an hour ago,”
he exclaimed impatiently. “What’s been keeping
you?”</p>

<p>“Jump in, and we’ll tell you while we’re going
up to the house,” said Lee, and then he and
Bobby told him all about their encounter with
Boolus. As Bobby had predicted, Fred was
greatly disappointed at having missed the adventure.</p>

<p>“But I’ll have to admit you made good use of
that extra hour,” he conceded. “I was getting
mad as a hornet when you didn’t show up on time,
because I’ve got the motor boat all provisioned
and ready to start. And it’s a peach of a boat,
too,” he added.</p>

<p>“Well, that’s the kind we want,” said Bobby.
“I’m all ready to start at a moment’s notice.”</p>

<p>“We’ll have to go to the house first,” said Lee,
“but that won’t take us long.”</p>

<p>To save time, Lee told Mose to go to the boat
landing and wait for them there, so that he could
take the horse and buggy back when they got
there.</p>

<p>“We Southerners just hate to walk when we
can ride,” he explained. “Besides, it will save
time.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Cartier insisted that they have lunch, although
if left to themselves the boys would have
preferred to start their trip and eat in the boat.
They told her about the encounter with Jim
Boolus, and when they saw how anxious she became
they felt sorry for the first time that it had
happened. However, there was nothing to be
done about it, and after a hasty meal they said
good-by to her, jumped into the buggy, and in a
short time were at the tiny boathouse.</p>

<p>This was situated in a small creek or inlet, and
was built right over the water, so that one had
only to open the doors and guide the boat out.
The boat itself was a staunch little twenty-foot
craft with a dependable two-cylinder motor to
drive it, and Fred had seen to it that Mose should
have the brass work shining. The negro had
been far from enthusiastic over this job.</p>

<p>“Whut’s de use to scrub up all dat brass,” he
had argued, “when it won’t be no time at all before
de mist from de ribber has it green ag’in.
Seems t’me it would be more sensible like to
spend de time restin’ out in de nice warm sun.”</p>

<p>“You might as well say it’s no use eating because
you’ll only get hungry again,” Fred had
told him. “I’ll bet you don’t believe that though,
do you?”</p>

<p>“Nossuh,” said Mose, with a broad grin, “dat’s
a diff’rent breed o’ cats, suh.”</p>

<p>Apparently convinced by Fred’s argument, he
had fallen to with a will, with such good results
that the motor boat now looked spick and span
enough to go in some water festival.</p>

<p>“It sho looks nifty,” admitted Mose, “but mah
elbow aches yet when Ah reflects how hard Ah
had to dig befo’ Ah got it dat way.”</p>

<p>“Never mind,” said Lee, as he gave the flywheel
a twist that set the motor to chugging in
a business-like manner. “When we come back
we’ll bring you some swamp chickens for supper,
Mose.”</p>

<p>“Whut’s dem swamp chickums?” inquired the
negro. “Cain’t seem to rec’lect no sech fowl no-how.”</p>

<p>“Oh, certainly,” said Lee, with every appearance
of conviction. “They have black combs, red
tail feathers, and blue eyes. You must have seen
one, haven’t you?”</p>

<p>“Nossuh, an’ whut’s more, Ah don’ believe dey
never was no sech a kind of a chickum,” said
Mose.</p>

<p>“All right, then, just you wait till we bring you
one back,” said Lee, and guided the boat out into
the sluggish river, leaving Mose scratching his
woolly head on the bank.</p>

<p>The river was perhaps a hundred feet wide at
this point, and flowed so slowly that it was hard to
believe that there was any current at all. The
banks were covered with trees that grew right
down to the water’s edge at this point, but as the
little craft chugged its way upstream, the trees
gave way to high, rank grass, with here and there
a lofty cypress tree shooting up out of the rank
vegetation.</p>

<p>“We’re on the edge of the swamp country
now,” explained Lee. “In another hour we’ll be
right in the heart of it.”</p>

</div>

<div id='chXVIII' class='chapter'>
<h2>CHAPTER XVIII<br/>A SCOUNDREL’S TRICK</h2>

<p class='first'>“What’s the chance of catching some fish?” inquired
Bobby. “There’s nothing better than
fresh caught fish grilled over a wood fire.”</p>

<p>“There are plenty of fish if you have the luck
to catch them,” said Lee. “They generally eat
the bait off my hook, and then go away laughing
at me.”</p>

<p>“Huh, I never saw a fish laugh, myself,” said
Fred; “it must be very interesting.”</p>

<p>“Oh, it is,” Lee gravely assured him. “We’ll
just land at a good place I know of, and maybe
you can have a demonstration.”</p>

<p>They chugged on a little further, and then Lee
gave the wheel a twist and headed for a high
green bank that rose above the general level of
the flat swamp country. When about two hundred
feet away he shut off the motor, and the boat
glided gently on with its momentum and grounded
easily on the muddy bank.</p>

<p>“Here we are,” said the Southern youth. “Get
out your fishing lines, and we’ll see what we can
do.”</p>

<p>It did not take the boys long to rig up their
tackle, and then Lee jumped ashore, followed
by Bobby and Fred. Together they pulled the
bow of the boat up onto the bank, and then cast
their bait.</p>

<p>“Now to hear the laughing fish,” said Fred.
“Do they laugh very loud, Lee?”</p>

<p>“Not as loud as some poor fish that I know of,”
retorted Lee.</p>

<p>“Wow!” exclaimed Bobby, laughing. “That
had all the earmarks of a dig, Lee.”</p>

<p>Fred opened his mouth to make a cutting remark,
but at that moment his reel whizzed, and
for the next five minutes he was too busy to say
a word. The fish fought gamely, and the frail
rod at times bent almost double and threatened
to snap. But at last Fred landed the gleaming
fish on the grass.</p>

<p>“Good work!” applauded Lee. “After that I
take back my unkind words, Fred.”</p>

<p>“That’s all right,” said Fred, “nothing could
make me mad now. Isn’t that fish a beauty?
I’ll bet he weighs all of three pounds.”</p>

<p>“Wouldn’t be surprised,” assented Bobby.
“Two or three more like that, and we can have a
feast.”</p>

<p>But the required number failed to materialize,
and after half an hour of patient angling, the boys
decided to try their luck in a new location. Accordingly
they moved some two or three hundred
yards further upstream, and cast again. Here the
fish were biting better, and in a little while even
Lee had caught a fair sized fish, while Bobby and
Fred each had two to their credit. Content with
this haul, they decided to go back to the boat and
continue their journey. They strung the fish on
a bit of line, and then made their way back to
where they had left the craft.</p>

<p>But the motor boat was nowhere to be
seen!</p>

<p>For a moment all three were too surprised to
speak. Bobby was the first to break the dazed
silence.</p>

<p>“It looks as though we were up against it, fellows,”
he said, soberly. “How do you suppose
that boat got away, anyway?”</p>

<p>“It must be we didn’t pull it up far enough,”
said Lee, “although I didn’t think the current
was strong enough here to float a chip away.
But now it looks as though I made a bad mistake.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think there is any mistake about
this,” said Bobby, who had been doing some quick
thinking. “That boat would never have floated
away unless somebody had helped it to. We had
it drawn up too far for that.”</p>

<p>“But who in the world would there be here to
set it adrift?” inquired Lee, in bewilderment.</p>

<p>As though in answer to his question, there was a
sudden stir and rustle in a tall bunch of swamp
grass in back of them, and as they whirled about
they saw a young negro boy leap from the grass
and start running as fast as his legs could carry
him.</p>

<p>“After him, fellows!” yelled Bobby, and the
three comrades took after the negro at top speed.
The latter was fleet, but he was no match for
Bobby who soon outdistanced his companions and
was close on the negro’s heels. The darkey, hearing
the pursuit so close to him, suddenly turned,
and Bobby thought for a second that he was going
to show fight, but instead he fell on his knees
and started to beg for mercy.</p>

<p>“D—don’t hit me, white boy,” he stammered.
“Ah was made to do it, ’deed Ah was.”</p>

<p>“Do what?” asked Bobby. “I haven’t accused
you of doing anything yet.”</p>

<p>“Nossuh, you hasn’t, and Ah wouldn’t have
shoved off dat boat, neider, if mah boss hadn’t
done tole me he’d skin me alive if Ah didn’t.”</p>

<p>“I know this coon,” said Lee, who with Fred
came up panting at this juncture. “He works
for Jim Boolus, and I reckon that explains how
our boat came to get adrift. How did you know
we were here?” he continued, addressing the
negro.</p>

<p>“Ah was rowin’ Marse Boolus down de ribber,”
answered the darkey, “an’ fust thing Ah knows he
spies you-all’s boat wid its nose stuck up on de
mud bank. ‘Dat’s de Cartiers’ motor boat,’ he
says to me, gettin’ all excited. ‘Suppose young
Cartier and dose fresh friends o’ his’n must be
aroun’ somewhere!’”</p>

<p>“‘Yessuh,’ Ah says, and keeps right on rowin’.
But we hadn’t gone no distance ’tall when he
tells me to quit.”</p>

<p>“‘Gimme dem oars, you fool nigger,’ he says,
‘Ah’ll row dis boat in, and Ah wants you should
step ashore an’ heave dat boat off de bank.’”</p>

<p>“Ah jes’ had to do like he says, ’cause Marse
Boolus is a powerful mean man when he gits riled.
But Ah hadn’t any more dan got ashore when he
hears one of you white boys shoutin’ somethin’,
an’ he thinks you’re comin’ back for your boat.
Wid dat he starts pullin’ away like mad, leavin’
me up on de bank. Ah shoved off de boat, anyway,
thinkin’ dat he’d come back an’ pick me up,
but he jes’ kep’ right on goin’, and here I is.”</p>

<p>“We ought to pitch you into the river and let
you swim after him,” said Lee, angrily.</p>

<p>The frightened negro rolled his eyes. “Ah’s
sorry, boss,” he whimpered, “but Marse Boolus
would jest as soon land me wid an oar as not if
Ah didn’t do what he tole me to.”</p>

<p>“It’s no use bothering with him,” said Bobby.
“The damage is done now, and we’ll have to try
to get out of this mess some way.”</p>

<p>“I suppose Boolus is chuckling now to think
how he’s got even with us,” said Fred, clenching
his fists. “I wish now he’d fallen out of that
buggy onto some nice hard rocks instead of into
soft sand.”</p>

<p>“Well we’re in a pretty pickle, anyway,” said
Lee, as the full extent of the calamity began to
dawn on him. “We’re somewhere about the
middle of the swamp, without any way to get out
unless we swim, and no provisions except a few
fish.”</p>

<p>“Oh, it may not be quite as bad as that,” said
Bobby. “How do you know there’s no way out
except by the river? There’s probably some path
through, if we can only find it.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but that’s a big if,” said Lee. “But I
guess we might as well go back and get those fish
and cook them. We’ll have to camp out to-night,
anyway, and then see what we can do in the morning.”</p>

<p>As nobody could suggest anything better than
this, they made their way back to the river, taking
the negro with them. “There’s no knowing what
he’ll be up to,” said Lee. “We’d better keep an
eye on him.”</p>

<p>They cleaned and cooked the fish, and ate them
in silence, each one busy with his own thoughts.
The flat and dreary swamp spread out on all sides
of their camp, except that bounded by the river.
As evening came on, a cold white mist arose from
the morass, causing them to shiver and throw more
wood on their fire. Fortunately there was a
plentiful supply of driftwood along the shore,
and they resolved to keep the fire going all
night, each one taking a turn at standing watch
and putting fresh fuel on. As twilight deepened
into night, strange noises arose on every
side; the croaking of frogs, the weird calling of
water fowl, and above all the fierce hum of mosquitoes
that came in clouds to add to the discomfort
of their situation.</p>

<p>“Where’s that darkey?” exclaimed Lee suddenly.</p>

<p>They had momentarily forgotten him, and
now, when they looked around, there was no
sign of him. He had disappeared into the surrounding
blackness, and the boys knew that it
would be hopeless to look for him.</p>

<p>“It’s just as well, anyway,” said Fred. “He
had a treacherous look in his eyes, and I feel
better now that he’s not around.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but the chances are he knew of a way out
of this place,” said Lee, “and we might have
made him show it to us. But he’s gone, and
there’s no use worrying about it, I suppose.”</p>

<p>“Well, if he can get out, we can, too,” said
Bobby, hopefully. “We’ll get a start as soon as
it’s light enough to see, and maybe we’ll be home
in time for lunch.”</p>

</div>

<div id='chXIX' class='chapter'>
<h2>CHAPTER XIX<br/>IN DESPERATE PERIL</h2>

<p class='first'>Bobby stood the first watch, Fred the second,
and Lee the last. Nothing of any importance
occurred during the night, although the swamp
all around them seemed teeming with life.
Above the croaking of frogs and the hum of
night insects there rose at times a strange bellowing
noise, that sent shivers creeping over
Bobby and Fred, and which they were at a loss
to explain. But next morning Lee told them
the source of the strange noise.</p>

<p>“What you heard were alligators,” said Lee.
“There are lots of them in this swamp, and
we’ve got to look out for them. They’re pretty
fierce, and they’ll attack anything under the
sun.”</p>

<p>“Gee!” said Bobby, “if I had known that,
I think I’d have spent the night up a tree. I
could hear one pretty close while I was keeping
the fire going, too.”</p>

<p>“Probably he was attracted by the light of
the fire,” said Lee. “But I don’t think they’d
bother any one on land, as a rule. But they’ll
tackle anything in the water, and if they once
get a grip with those pointed teeth of theirs,
its all over for the one that’s caught. The
alligator just drags him down under the surface,
waits until he’s drowned and then drags him
up on the nearest sandbank and swallows him
at his leisure.”</p>

<p>“That’s fine—for the alligator,” muttered
Fred, with a slight shiver which was not all the
result of the clinging mist. “I don’t think I’ll
do much swimming while we’re in this swamp.”</p>

<p>“I’d advise you not to,” said Lee. “I sure
hate ’gators, but just the same I wouldn’t mind
finding a few of their eggs for breakfast.”</p>

<p>“Eggs!” exclaimed Bobby and Fred together.</p>

<p>“Certainly,” said Lee, laughing at their
amazed look. “I don’t care for them much as
a rule, but one or two now wouldn’t be half
bad.”</p>

<p>“Good-night!” exclaimed Fred. “What do
they taste like, anyway?”</p>

<p>“Oh, they’re not so bad. They have a rather
unpleasant musky taste, but if you’re hungry
enough you don’t mind that. The darkeys think
they’re fine, and spend a lot of time hunting them
out.”</p>

<p>“Where do you find the eggs?” inquired Fred.</p>

<p>“The ’gators dig out holes in the sand or mud,
fill them with eggs, and then cover the whole thing
over with more sand,” said Lee. “After a while
the heat of the sun hatches out the eggs, and then
the mother ’gator takes charge of the little fellows
and protects them until they’re big enough
to take care of themselves.”</p>

<p>“Well, I feel hungry enough now to eat an alligator
egg omelet,” said Bobby. “I think we’d
better get started, and maybe we’ll run across one
of those cute little nests Lee was telling us about.”</p>

<p>After eating the last of the fish they had caught
the day before, the boys started out, intending to
follow the river as nearly as possible. But they
soon found that the ground kept getting softer at
every step they took, and were forced to bear
away from the stream, although still keeping as
near as possible to the right direction. Lee was
more experienced than the other boys in the matter
of making progress over this kind of treacherous
footing, and he took the lead. On every side
dark pools of water oozed up through the quaking
ground. Here and there tussocks of grass had
formed, and these offered the only footing to be
had at all. Even these were very soft and shaky,
and it was necessary to leap continually from one
to the other in order to avoid sinking in. At rare
intervals some larger hillock then, usual would
give the boys a chance to rest a few minutes and
get their breath, and it was on one of these that
they paused at last, panting and tired.</p>

<p>“Gee!” exclaimed Bobby, as he mopped at his
streaming face. “A mile of this is worse than
ten miles on hard ground.”</p>

<p>“Harder, and a lot more dangerous,” agreed
Lee, soberly. “One fall into one of those green
pools and you’d be done for. It would suck you
down so fast that nothing could save you.”</p>

<p>The heat was growing intense, and, aided by the
rank steam that ascended from the rotting vegetation,
seemed almost unbearable. But the boys
knew that they had to keep on, because if darkness
found them before they reached some firmer
ground, their fate would be sealed. After nightfall
they would be almost certain to fall into one
of the green and stagnant pools and be sucked
down to a horrible death.</p>

<p>Even as the boys tried to rest and get their
breath, they could feel their feet slowly sinking
into the muddy grass, and as they lifted their
feet pools of water formed in the depressions left
by them.</p>

<p>“Guess it’s a case of ‘keep moving,’” said Fred,
as one foot sank in to his ankles and he pulled it
out with difficulty. “This swamp is the last place
in the world I’d pick for a hike if I had my
choice.”</p>

<p>“There’s no choice about this,” said Bobby,
setting his lips grimly. “We’re here, and we’ve
got to get out just as soon as we can. Let’s go!”</p>

<p>Somewhat rested by their brief halt, they
started on again. Suddenly Lee, who was ahead,
shouted a warning.</p>

<p>“We can’t get any farther this way!” he cried,
as Bobby and Fred caught up with him, and he
pointed ahead. The boys saw a large stagnant
pond, covered with green scum, from which protruded
the rotting trunks of trees. At intervals
around the bank lay what appeared to be other
logs, but even as they looked, one of these seeming
logs stirred, and crawling slowly through the ooze,
flopped into the water with a loud splash.</p>

<p>“We’re blocked, sure enough,” said Bobby.
“We’ll have to go back and try some fresh path.”</p>

<p>“Looks that way,” assented Lee. “And I hope
we find some bit of solid ground soon, fellows,
because I’m pretty near all in. I can’t go much
further.”</p>

<p>For the first time the boys realized the deadly
danger in which they stood. The strenuous exertions
necessary to keep away from being swallowed
up by the black mud, the terrific heat, and
the deadly gases that rose continually from the
rotting vegetable matter, were all combining to
sap their strength. And if that once gave out they
realized there was no alternative but death in
the clinging, suffocating mud.</p>

<p>Bobby felt his own heart sink, but he showed
nothing of this in his manner as he said: “Ah,
we’ll be all right in a little while, Lee. We’re
bound to hit dry ground pretty soon. Keep a
stiff upper lip and we’ll get through right
enough.”</p>

<p>“Well, you’d better set the pace, and I’ll do my
best to keep up,” returned the Southern boy.</p>

<p>Accordingly, Bobby started off, followed by Lee,
with Fred last. Bobby had become somewhat
used to picking his way over the grass tussocks
by this time, and in addition he seemed to have
a sort of instinct which, told him what path to
take and which to avoid. Under his guidance
they made better progress, and after a time Fred
remarked:</p>

<p>“I may be only dreaming, but it seems to me
that the ground is getting a little firmer. What
do you fellows think?”</p>

<p>“I reckon it is,” panted Lee. “I’ve heard the
darkeys say there was an island in the swamp
somewhere, and maybe we’re getting near it.”</p>

<p>Sure enough, they soon spied higher ground
ahead of them, with some trees growing on it.
The sight gave them fresh courage, and they
struggled gamely on, until at last came a time
when they could put foot to ground without feeling
it sink into slimy mud.</p>

</div>

<div id='chXX' class='chapter'>
<h2>CHAPTER XX<br/>THE ALLIGATOR’S JAWS</h2>

<p class='first'>“Thank Heaven,” gasped Lee, as the three
boys threw themselves down and lay panting in
the grateful shade of a big tree. “I’m all in. I
couldn’t possibly have gone half a mile more.”</p>

<p>“I guess we’re about as bad,” said Fred. “I’m
willing to admit that I was never so near the end
of my rope. Any one would have thought you
knew this island was here, Bobby, from the way
you headed for it.”</p>

<p>“It was just a guess,” declared Bobby. “I
figured that probably if we got further away from
the river the ground might be less swampy and
it would pay us to go in that direction even if we
were getting farther from home.”</p>

<p>“We wouldn’t have got there very fast the way
I was heading you anyway,” said Lee. “Poor
mother will be terribly worried about us.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” agreed Bobby soberly, “that’s the
trouble; when, we fellows get into trouble of any
kind, our mothers suffer more over it than we
do.”</p>

<p>In a short time they had recovered a good deal
from their strenuous exertions, and now all three
found themselves ravenously hungry. But to feel
hungry and to satisfy that hunger were two very
different things, as they soon discovered. They
had read of people marooned on islands in the
ocean, but in every such case there had seemed to
be a convenient flock of goats or a handy beach
strewn with shellfish. But after the boys had
thoroughly ransacked their island, they found no
such convenient supply. The place was only
about a quarter of a mile across, hemmed in on
every side with brown water and black mud.</p>

<p>Luckily, however, they had hung onto their
fishing rods, and they had no difficulty in digging
up a plentiful supply of worms in the rich earth.
Fred was the first to get a bite, and he reeled in
the fish as fast as he could, being much too eager
to see the fish toasting over a fire to make any attempt
to “play” him. It was not long before
they had four small fish, and these they proceeded
to clean and kill without wasting any time over
it.</p>

<p>“Scubbity-yow!” exclaimed Fred, as he bit
into the delicious morsel, “I never knew a fish
could taste so good. These fellows are only samples.
We’ll have to get busy and catch about
a hundred more before I’ll feel satisfied.”</p>

<p>“If you’ll eat a hundred, I’ll catch them for
you,” laughed Bobby.</p>

<p>“And I’ll clean them and cook them for you,”
seconded Lee.</p>

<p>“All right, go ahead and start in,” said Fred,
but the others were not to be taken in so easily.</p>

<p>“No, you don’t,” laughed Bobby. “You get
busy and catch some yourself. I’ll bet you
couldn’t eat two more to save your life.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’d have a lot of fun trying, anyway,”
said Fred, regretfully. “But if you fellows are
too lazy to catch fish for me, I suppose I’ll have
to do it myself.”</p>

<p>“Looks a lot that way,” agreed Lee, as he cast
his line into the water. “You’d better hurry,
too, before Bobby and I have them all out.”</p>

<p>They caught and ate fish until they could eat
no more, and then lay down in the shade to rest.</p>

<p>“This might be worse, I suppose,” said Bobby,
chewing reflectively on a long blade of grass. “A
couple of hours ago it would have seemed like
Heaven to us.”</p>

<p>“It isn’t so bad here,” said Lee, “but we can’t
stay here forever, and after we leave we’ll be as
badly off as we were before.”</p>

<p>“Likely,” admitted Bobby, “but then, on the
other hand, it doesn’t seem possible we’ll strike
anything worse than we went through this morning,
anyway.”</p>

<p>“Oh, cut out worrying about the future,” broke
in Fred. “For my part, I’ve had enough to eat—although
I’ll admit a steady fish diet is beginning
to get tiresome—and I’ve got a soft and
shady place to lie where I can hear the little birdies
singing. So why worry, say I.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Lee, scornfully, “and you can hear
the pretty alligators singing, too, if you listen
hard. Not to mention the mosquitoes and bull-frogs.”</p>

<p>“Better let him be cheerful while he can, Lee,”
said Bobby. “He’ll soon forget how happy he is
after we get started again.”</p>

<p>“Well, we’ve got a lot to be thankful for, anyway,”
contended Fred. “Suppose we’d all been
as fat as Pee Wee, and had to go hopping through
this everlasting swamp like—like—”</p>

<p>“Like turkeys on a hot stove?” suggested Lee.</p>

<p>“That seems to about cover it.” said Fred, with
a laugh, “even if it isn’t very complimentary to
us. But as I was saying, if we’d all been as fat
as Pee Wee, we’d never have got here at all. This
swamp was never intended for heavyweights.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think it was ever intended for any kind
of human being,” said Lee.</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know about that,” said Bobby.
“It strikes me that this would be an ideal place to
put Ap Plunkit and Ben Tompkins, for instance.”</p>

<p>“Wow!” yelled Fred, delightedly. “You certainly
had an idea that time, Bobby. And while
we’re at it, why not Sandy Jackson and his friend,
Snath? Seems to me they’d fit in pretty well,
too.”</p>

<p>“Come to think of it, though,” said Bobby, with
a serious air, “don’t you think it would be playing
it rather low down on the poor alligators!
What have they ever done to us that we should
wish that bunch on them?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps you’re right,” conceded Fred. “I
hadn’t thought of that before. But I guess some
of those big fellows we saw this morning are able
to take care of themselves.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know who those fellows are you’re
talking about, except Snath,” said Lee, “but if
they’re any meaner than alligators, I don’t want
to know anything about them. They’re the
meanest things alive, I think.”</p>

<p>“Speaking of ’gators reminds me,” said Bobby,
“why not try and locate some of those eggs you
were telling us about, Lee? A little change of
diet wouldn’t do us any harm.”</p>

<p>“All right, let’s look for some,” said Lee,
springing to his feet, “that is, if Fred isn’t having
too good a time doing nothing to be disturbed.”</p>

<p>“No rest for the wicked,” groaned Fred, scrambling
to his feet. “Lead on, Lee, I’m with you.”</p>

<p>The three boys followed around the shore, looking
for a sandy beach, which, as Lee told them,
was the most likely place to find the eggs. Lee
had cut himself a sharp stick, and when they had
at last found a sandy place, he stuck this into the
sand at intervals, afterwards examining the end to
see if it had found a nest. After quite a time
spent in fruitless proddings, he at last met with
success. The end of the stick came up dripping
yellow.</p>

<p>“Here’s a nest!” he shouted. “Dig in, fellows
and we’ll soon have all we want.”</p>

<p>Suiting the action to the word, he began scooping
up the sand with his hands, and Bobby and
Fred followed suit. In a short time they had uncovered
a small heap of alligator eggs, each one
about the size of a goose’s egg. Absorbed in their
find, they had no thought of danger, until suddenly
Bobby, chancing to glance up, gave a wild
yell of warning. Springing to their feet, Fred
and Lee saw a huge alligator, measuring a good
fifteen feet, almost on top of them, great jaws
gaping and small, vicious eyes snapping wickedly!</p>

</div>

<div id='chXXI' class='chapter'>
<h2>CHAPTER XXI<br/>A TERRIBLE MOMENT</h2>

<p class='first'>All three boys jumped for safety, but Fred’s
ankle turned in the soft sand, and he fell, striking
his head against a stone as he went down.
Stunned, he lay an easy prey for the alligator,
that made for him with all the speed of which it
was capable.</p>

<p>For a brief second Bobby and Lee stood rooted
in their tracks, appalled at the horrible menace
to their friend. Then, quick as a flash, Bobby
leaped toward the ugly monster, picking up the
stick Lee had been using for hunting eggs.</p>

<p>The alligator was not ten feet from Fred when
Bobby leaped in front of it, and using the stick as
a club, dealt the ferocious brute a stinging blow
on the end of its snout. The vicious little eyes
blinked, but the monster did not stop. Again
Bobby struck, with all the strength of his sinewy
young arm. The great jaws snapped wickedly,
but the alligator could not stand this severe pain
in the only sensitive part of his anatomy, and it
stopped a moment, glaring at this presumptuous
human who looked so small and yet could hurt so
much. Following up his advantage, Bobby struck
again, and at the same second Lee dashed in and,
exerting all his strength, lifted Fred in his arms
and staggered off with him.</p>

<p>The alligator, infuriated at being thus deprived
of its prey, made a wild lunge at Bobby, who tried
to land another effective blow on the sensitive
snout. But this time he missed, and the big reptile
caught the stick in its jaws, snapping it to
splinters. Bobby was thrown off his balance and
nearly followed the stick, but recovered his poise
just in time, for the alligator turned with surprising
agility and slashed at him with its heavy
tail. Had that deadly blow reached its mark
Bobby’s career would have ended. He could not
recover his balance in time to run, but as the
powerful tail whizzed toward him he seized the
only chance left him, and leaped clear over it.
The alligator never got another chance at him,
for when he landed he was off like a shot after
his chums. The alligator followed him for a few
steps, but apparently saw that it was hopeless to
try to catch him, and turning, dragged itself down
to the water, which it entered with a sullen splash.</p>

<p>Bobby, seeing this over his shoulder, slowed
down and called to Lee, who laid Fred on the
ground and started trying to revive him. By the
time Bobby arrived Fred had opened his eyes, and
now, with Lee’s help, he made shift to sit up.</p>

<p>“What happened to me?” he inquired, feebly.</p>

<p>“Not near as much as almost happened to
you,” said Bobby. “You came pretty near waking
up inside an alligator. But how do you feel
now, Fred?” and he knelt beside his chum to examine
a bad looking cut just over his temple.</p>

<p>“Oh, a little dizzy but I guess I can still sit up
and take notice,” said Fred, with a weak grin.
“I remember falling now, and I suppose I must
have knocked my head on something. What happened
after that?”</p>

<p>“Oh, nothing much,” said Bobby. “I took the
alligator’s attention off you, and Lee toted you
away to a safer place than the neighborhood of
that nest. I’ve got an idea that must have been
the owner of those eggs that attacked us.”</p>

<p>“The way you tell it, it doesn’t seem like much,
but I’ve got an idea you and Lee saved my life,”
said Fred.</p>

<p>“Oh well, we only did what you would have done
for either of us if we had been down and out,”
said Bobby, “so let’s forget about it. The worst
part of it is we’re as far as ever from having alligator
egg omelet.”</p>

<p>“Well, let’s go back and get them, then,” said
Fred coolly, getting to his feet. “My head still
feels a little funny, but anyway I can keep a look-out,
while you two get the eggs. We won’t be
caught napping this time, and I guess we can run
faster than any ’gator.”</p>

<p>“I like your nerve, anyway!” exclaimed Lee,
“Here you’ve been within an ace of being gobbled
up by that ugly brute, and still you want to go
back and have another try at her precious eggs.
Likely enough she’ll get you for good this time.”</p>

<p>“I’m game to try it, anyway,” said Bobby.
“But I don’t think you’d better come, Fred.
That was a pretty bad crack you got, and you’d
better wait here while we try it.”</p>

<p>“Not a bit of it,” protested Fred. “I feel all
right now, and I’m going to have alligator eggs
for supper if I have to go for them alone.”</p>

<p>“All right then, back we go,” said Bobby, and
the three boys retraced their steps to where they
had all three narrowly escaped death only a few
minutes before. When they arrived, there was no
sign of the alligator, however, and it did not take
them long to uncover the eggs. There was a large
number of them, each one about the size and shape
of a large goose egg, and the boys took off their
coats and wrapped as many of the eggs as they
could carry in them. But they took no chances of
being surprised this time, and kept a sharp look-out.
And it was well they did, for they had no
more than got the eggs wrapped up than Lee gave
a shout of warning.</p>

<p>“Here she comes, fellows!” he yelled, “let’s
go!”</p>

<p>The boys needed no second admonition, but after
a startled glance, took to their heels in most
earnest fashion. For sure enough, the mother
alligator, after cooling her smarting nose in the
water, had had an uneasy feeling that all was
not well, and had started up the bank to investigate.
When she caught sight of the boys she
gave a bellow and dragged herself through the
sand at increased speed, but the boys did not wait
for her coming this time, and were soon at a safe
distance.</p>

<p>“Gee!” exclaimed Bobby, slowing down. “It’s
a lucky thing that alligators can’t run fast. If
they could, I guess we’d have to live in trees.”</p>

<p>“They’re slow enough on land, but you ought
to see them in the water,” returned Lee. “They
can go fast enough then, believe me.”</p>

<p>“I’ll believe you right away, without putting it
to a test,” laughed Fred. “An alligator’s mouth
seems too full of teeth to suit me.”</p>

<p>“Yes, they have got a pretty complete outfit,”
said Lee, “and they keep growing in all the time,
the new ones forcing out the old. I’ve heard that
a ’gator has four or five sets of teeth during a
lifetime.”</p>

<p>“Gee!” exclaimed Bobby. “I should think
one set like that would last any animal a lifetime.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but they often break them taking bites
out of people who try to steal their eggs,” said
Lee. “It must hurt the poor alligators when they
break a tooth that way.”</p>

<p>“That’s the only reason I ran so fast,” said
Fred. “I wasn’t afraid of the alligator, but I
didn’t want the poor thing to hurt its teeth
on me.”</p>

<p>“Oh, we believe that,” said Lee sarcastically.</p>

<p>“Well, if you believe that, you’ll believe anything,”
said Fred brazenly. “I’ll have to think
up something real good next time.”</p>

<p>“I don’t mind telling you fellows the real reason
why I ran, if you coax me,” declared Bobby.</p>

<p>“I’ll bite,” said Lee. “Why did you run?”</p>

<p>“Because I couldn’t fly,” replied Bobby.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII<br/>THE DISTANT HOWL</h2>

<p class='first'>“That sounds like one of Billy’s jokes,” declared
Fred, “and I can’t say anything worse
than that about it.”</p>

<p>“No, that’s a pretty hard knock, all right,” admitted
Bobby, “but I’ll try not to do it again.”</p>

<p>“As a punishment, I vote that we appoint
Bobby to try the first alligator’s egg,” suggested
Lee.</p>

<p>“Second the motion!” shouted Fred enthusiastically.
“You’re unanimously elected,
Bobby.”</p>

<p>“Well, somebody had to try Limburger cheese
the first time,” said Bobby, “so I suppose I might
as well be the goat this time. But you’ll have to
tell me how to cook them, Lee.”</p>

<p>“You can cook them any way, the same as a
hen’s egg,” said Lee. “But I suppose, seeing
we’ve nothing to boil water in, that we’d better
roast a few and try them that way.”</p>

<p>“It doesn’t matter to me,” said Bobby. “As
long as I’m to be official taster, they’ll probably
taste just as bad one way as another.”</p>

<p>During this conversation, the boys had been
heading for the spot where they had eaten lunch,
and having reached it they proceeded to build a
fire. They soon had a good blaze going, and in
accordance with Lee’s directions, let it burn down
until there was nothing but red embers left.
Then they dug out a space under the ashes, placed
a few of the eggs in the hollow, and raked the hot
ashes over them.</p>

<p>“Leave them there a few minutes, and they’ll
be fit for a king to eat,” said the Southern boy.</p>

<p>“Seems to me you’re what Mr. Leith would call
an unbounded optimist,” said Bobby. “I’ve got
my doubts if they’ll even be fit for me to eat, let
alone a king.”</p>

<p>“Well, we won’t have long to wait to find out,”
said Lee. “I imagine they’re pretty nearly
cooked now.”</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t be in a hurry,” said Bobby. “I’m
perfectly willing to wait a while, you know.”</p>

<p>“Maybe you are, but we’re not,” retorted Lee,
as he scraped the fire aside and fished out an egg.
“Here you are, Bobby, I’ve tasted them before
and they’re not really so bad, especially when
you’re hungry. Go to it.”</p>

<p>“How do you eat the things, anyway?” asked
Bobby, looking doubtfully at the strange object.
“I suppose neither of you happens to have an egg
cup and a spoon in your pocket, have you?”</p>

<p>“I usually carry them around with me, but I
reckon I must have lost them,” said Lee, sarcastically.
“Just chip the end off, and go to it, Bobby.
You’ll enjoy it, believe me.”</p>

<p>“I’d like to believe you, but I’m afraid I can’t,”
said Bobby. “Well, I can only die once. Good-by,
fellows. Here goes.”</p>

<p>He chipped part of the thick outside covering
off the egg, and very gingerly took a small bite.</p>

<p>“What’s it like?” questioned Fred, watching
him anxiously. “Is it as bad as I think it is?”</p>

<p>“It isn’t bad at all, if I only had a little salt to
go with it,” said Bobby, taking another and
larger bite this time. “You fellows had better
dig in, or there won’t be any left.”</p>

<p>“What does it taste like, anyway?” asked Fred,
doubtfully.</p>

<p>“Alligator egg,” returned Bobby, munching
away. “I was elected to try these eggs first, but
there was nothing in it about telling you fellows
what they tasted like. Try ’em for yourselves.”</p>

<p>“But that was the idea that you should taste
them, so you could tell us whether they were good
or not,” complained Fred.</p>

<p>“You should have thought of that at the time,
then,” said Bobby. “It’s too late now. Help
yourself. After all, the only way to learn is by
experience, as the coach is always telling us back
at Rockledge.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m getting hungry enough to eat an alligator,
much less its eggs. Pass me over one of
those things, will you, Lee?”</p>

<p>“Sure thing,” said that individual, “and while
I’m about it, I reckon I’ll have one for myself.”</p>

<p>Presently all three boys were munching away,
and after they had each eaten two of the eggs the
general verdict was that they “were not half
bad.”</p>

<p>“I only wish I could get a few home with me,”
said Bobby, with a mischievous twinkle in his eye.
“I’d like to give a few to our cook, Meena, and see
what she’d do about it. She says she doesn’t like
boys, and I’ve got a hunch she’d like this one less
after that.”</p>

<p>“I wish I had a few of her doughnuts,” sighed
Fred. “I don’t think she likes me much, but
sometimes I can’t help liking her after I’ve eaten
some of the good things she cooks.”</p>

<p>“Please don’t mention it,” returned Bobby.
“It makes my mouth water just to think of it.
Those eggs are filling, but that’s about the best
you can say of them. But I suppose we ought to
be thankful to have even them. Those and what
fish we can catch wouldn’t keep us going very long,
though. When shall we make another try to get
out of this everlasting swamp?”</p>

<p>“I think we’d better start as soon as it’s light
enough to see, to-morrow,” said Lee. “I hate to
think of tackling the bog again, but we’ve just
got to do it.”</p>

<p>“Well, then, that’s settled,” came from Fred.
“We’ll get a good sleep to-night and start strong,
anyway. Don’t you think it would be a good idea
to cook a lot of those eggs and take them along
with us? There’s no telling how long it may be
before we find any other food.”</p>

<p>“That’s a good idea,” said Bobby. “Let’s get
busy and cook some right now. Thank fortune
they are fresh.”</p>

<p>Before long the boys had a dozen of the alligator’s
eggs cooked hard. By the time they had finished
this task, it was nearly dark, and after
gathering a good supply of firewood they built up
the blaze and lay down to discuss their plans for
the morrow.</p>

<p>As night came on all manner of strange noises
arose from the swamp, chief among them being
the snorting bellow of the alligators. Suddenly,
in a momentary lull, they heard, far off, a wild,
long-drawn cry, that hushed their voices and set
their hair creeping.</p>

<p>The shrieking wail, carrying an indescribable
note of ferocity and menace, rose and fell, and
then was gone, eclipsed by the nearer noises of the
swamp, that now resumed their usual volume.</p>

<p>“What was that?” whispered Fred, as the boys
gazed wide-eyed at each other.</p>

<p>“That was the cry of a cougar,” said Lee, his
voice a trifle shaky.</p>

<p>“A cougar!” exclaimed Fred, “what’s that?”</p>

<p>“Its a kind of panther,” explained Lee.
“There used to be a lot of them around here, but
now there aren’t many left. What there are,
though, are fierce enough to make up for that.”</p>

<p>“Gee!” exclaimed Bobby. “I hope that fellow
doesn’t take it into his head to pay us a visit.”</p>

<p>“He wouldn’t be likely to come into the swamp
this far,” said Lee, although there was not much
conviction in his voice. “But we’ll have to be on
our guard anyway. We’d better stand watches
to-night and keep the fire going.”</p>

<p>“We’d probably have had to do that, anyhow,”
said Fred. “Your Southern winters aren’t like
the ones we’re used to up North, but just the same
it’s pretty cold sleeping out at night without any
blankets.”</p>

<p>“I should say so,” said Bobby. “It’s fairly
warm when the sun’s shining, but I thought I was
going to freeze to death last night, sure.”</p>

<p>The boys listened anxiously for a repetition of
the wild cry that had so disturbed them, but apparently
the cougar was not coming in their direction,
for they heard nothing further to indicate
his presence. Nevertheless, they kept a good fire
going all that night, which prevented the one on
watch from seeing two glowing green eyes whose
owner prowled restlessly about just beyond range
of the firelight, as silent as any shadow but more
to be feared than the bellowing alligators, who
made the night hideous with their noise.</p>

</div>

<div id='chXXIII' class='chapter'>
<h2>CHAPTER XXIII<br/>TRACKED BY A PANTHER</h2>

<p class='first'>But in, the morning there was no sign of this
midnight prowler, and with the rising sun the boys
gave little thought to the weird sounds of the night
before. They were up at the first break of dawn,
somewhat sore and stiff from the effects of their
hard bed, but still full of “pep” for anything the
day might have to offer.</p>

<p>They had decided to follow in a general way the
course that had taken them so far, that is, head in
the general direction of home, but still keep away
from the impassable low ground in the vicinity of
the river. Bobby wanted Lee to take the lead, but
the latter objected.</p>

<p>“I got us into a pretty bad mess the last time,”
he said, “and you got us out again. So now,
you’d better lead again.”</p>

<p>“Oh, it was mostly luck on my part,” Bobby replied.
“How did I know we were going to hit
on this island?”</p>

<p>“Your brand of luck is what we need, then,”
said Lee. “Let’s hope it will hold out long
enough to get us out of this swamp.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll do my best, then,” said Bobby, “but
don’t blame me if I land you at the bottom of
some nice mudhole.”</p>

<p>“I’ll take a chance on your getting through all
right, and it will be more than luck that does it,
too,” said Fred.</p>

<p>“Let’s go, then,” urged Bobby; and the three
friends resumed their perilous journey.</p>

<p>They had by this time become so expert in
choosing the best spots to step that they found
their progress less arduous than they had expected.
But now a new difficulty arose, for the
sun became clouded over, and this left them at a
loss as to direction, this having been their only
guide so far.</p>

<p>Bobby grew more and more anxious as the haziness
continued to increase, and at last called a
halt on a bit of high ground that was a little
harder than the surrounding bog.</p>

<p>“Looks as though we’re rather up against it
now, fellows,” he said. “If we can’t see the sun,
we won’t know what direction we’re going in, and
chances are we’ll just be getting in deeper all the
time instead of getting out.”</p>

<p>“But we can’t stay here,” objected Lee.
“We’ve just got to keep going, and hope we’ll
come out somewhere, anyway. We know we’re
headed about right now, so why not try to keep on
that way?”</p>

<p>Bobby shook his head doubtfully, but as there
seemed to be no alternative, except to return to
their island, he started on again. Indeed, he felt
far from certain that he could find the island
again, or he might have proposed going back to it.</p>

<p>Fortunately, the ground seemed to be getting
somewhat firmer, but as they progressed the trees
and undergrowth became so dense that they found
increasing difficulty in making progress. Several
times Bobby stopped and peered about uneasily
among the trees, apparently in search of something
which he could not locate.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter, Bobby?” asked Fred, at
last, made uneasy by his friend’s uneasiness.
“What are you looking for, anyway?”</p>

<p>“I may be wrong,” said Bobby, stopping again,
“but I can’t help feeling as though we were being
followed and watched by something. I thought I
saw something in the underbrush just a little while
ago, but it was gone so quickly that I couldn’t be
sure.”</p>

<p>“What did it look like?” queried Lee, quickly.</p>

<p>“I’m not sure, as I say, that I saw anything,”
said Bobby, “but it just seemed to me as though
I saw a flash of light brown against a tree trunk,
and then it disappeared so quickly that I thought
I might be mistaken.”</p>

<p>“Light brown?” whispered Lee, with a frightened
look in his eyes. “Bobby, that’s the color
of a cougar, and you remember that cry we heard
last night—”</p>

<p>His voice trailed off into silence, and the boys
peered fearfully through the matted tangle of
vines and underbrush. They could see nothing to
confirm their fears, but suddenly a twig snapped
not far from this, and they thought they could
hear a stealthy rustling.</p>

<p>“What would we better do, Bobby?” asked
Fred, anxiously. “If we only had a gun with us,
we could soon take care of that fellow if he comes
after us, but as it is—”</p>

<p>He had no need to finish the sentence, for his
companions knew what he meant. Unarmed, with
not even a knife among them, except, of course,
their pocket knives, they would be no match for
the savage beast that was stalking them. In all
probability, as Lee told them, the panther would
wait until toward dark, and then leap on them at
the first opportunity.</p>

<p>“If that’s so,” said Bobby, who had been doing
some quick thinking, “it seems to me as though
we’d best pick out the place to fight it out instead
of leaving it to Mr. Cougar.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but one place looks about as bad as another
to me around here,” said Lee. “What’s
your idea, Bobby?”</p>

<p>“I think we’d better get up a tree,” said Bobby,
“then if he comes up after us, as he’ll probably
do if we keep him waiting long enough, we’ll have
a chance of beating him off with clubs. On the
ground here there’s hardly room enough to move,
and he’d have us at his mercy.”</p>

<p>Bobby had hardly finished speaking when they
heard another stick snap, closer this time than
before, and although still they could see nothing,
they had little need of their eyes to tell them that
the peril was close and imminent.</p>

<p>“There’s a big tree over there,” said Bobby,
pointing to a towering giant that stood somewhat
apart from the rest. “We’ll make for that, but
take it easy, so it won’t look as though we were
in a hurry.”</p>

<p>He started toward the tree indicated, pausing
only long enough to pick up a stout section of a
fallen branch that lay at his feet. Fred and Lee
followed his example, and they made quietly for
the tree, controlling an almost overpowering impulse
to break into a run. They kept a wary
lookout, and before they reached it, all three saw
the cougar plainly as he crossed a slight opening
in the underbrush. He was gone again in a second,
but the boys knew now beyond any doubt who
their enemy was.</p>

<p>“We’ll be lucky if he leaves us alone until we
get up the tree,” said Fred, voicing the thought
that was in all their minds.</p>

<p>“We’ll have to chance that,” said Bobby. “I’ll
be the last one to go up, and I’ll pass the clubs up
to you.”</p>

<p>By this time they had reached the tree, still unmolested
by the panther. Lee started up first,
and then Fred. Bobby admitted afterward that
he spent a nervous two minutes on the ground,
waiting for them to get far enough up so that he
could start. Every second he expected a lithe
form to hurl itself upon him. In reality it was
only a few seconds before Fred reached down for
the clubs, for both he and Lee were climbing
faster than they had ever done before in all their
active lives. The boys passed the clubs from one
to the other, two climbing while the other hung
on and held them, and in this manner they quickly
negotiated the twenty odd feet to the heavy
branches. As they swung themselves into a
broad fork they noticed for the first time that
their fingers were torn and bleeding from contact
with the rough bark, but they were too thankful
at being there to worry about that.</p>

<p>“Gee!” exclaimed Bobby, drawing a long
breath of relief as he peered downward in search
of their foe, “I expected to feel that brute’s claws
in my shoulder every second.”</p>

<p>“So did I,” said Fred. “If he’d attacked us
while we were shinnying up, it would have been all
over for us.”</p>

<p>“We’re a long way from being safe yet,” Lee
reminded them. “That beast can climb a tree
like a cat going over a fence, and he won’t leave
us alone here, you can bet on that.”</p>

<p>“Well, let him come,” said Bobby, coolly, as he
drew his jackknife and proceeded to whittle a
handle on his club. “We’ve got a chance here
anyway. I only hope he doesn’t try to starve
us out. We can’t stay up here forever, if he decides
to play a waiting game.”</p>

<p>“There he is!” shouted Lee, almost before
Bobby had ceased speaking. And sure enough,
the cougar, apparently deciding that he would
no longer keep to cover, came bounding out into
the little open space at the base of the tree. He
glared upward with baleful eyes and paced quickly
around the tree a few times, switching his long
tail and growling ominously.</p>

<p>The boys gripped their clubs and braced themselves,
expecting the brute to come climbing upward
at any second. The cougar seemed in no
hurry, however, but kept circling the tree, growling
louder all the time and evidently working himself
into a greater rage with every step.</p>

<p>“Hold my club a minute, Fred,” exclaimed
Bobby, suddenly. “I’ve got an idea,” and without
further explanation, he set feverishly to work
hacking off some of the smaller branches near
him. Without exactly knowing what his plan was,
Fred and Lee started cutting too, and between
them they soon had quite an armful. Bobby then
took all these branches, and with some fish line
he drew from his pocket he proceeded to lash
them to the tree just below the crotch in which
they were perched.</p>

<p>“When, he comes, that will slow him down, and
give us a chance at him,” explained Bobby.</p>

<p>“Fine,” exclaimed Fred and Lee together.
“But look out, fellows!” Lee added, “he’s getting
ready to climb!”</p>

<p>The panther, who had been watching these proceedings
suspiciously, seemed suddenly to make
up his mind, and with a vicious, spitting snarl
leaped to the trunk of the tree and started up at a
terrific pace. The boys gripped their clubs, and
with wildly beating hearts awaited the onslaught
of the ferocious animal.</p>

</div>

<div id='chXXIV' class='chapter'>
<h2>CHAPTER XXIV<br/>SWALLOWED UP BY THE BOG</h2>

<p class='first'>The cougar quickly reached the screen of
branches that Bobby had arranged, and here he
hesitated, not understanding the nature of this
obstacle. The tawny head was within two feet of
the boys, and they found themselves looking fairly
into the wicked green eyes that glared at them
through the frail network of branches.</p>

<p>But the panther had little chance to solve the
puzzle before him, for with one accord the boys,
wielding their clubs with a strength born of desperation,
rained blows upon his head. The cougar
growled and spit furiously, and struck viciously
at them with wicked claws extended. But
he was at a disadvantage, for he could only use
one paw, being forced to cling to the tree with the
others. For a few minutes he battled furiously,
and it seemed as though he would force his way
past the barrage of blows descending on him.
One sweep of his paw caught Fred’s club and tore
it out of his grasp, and it was only by a tremendous
effort that Fred kept himself from following
it to the ground. Then Bobby, risking all on one
blow, let go his hold on the branch, where he had
been steadying himself, stood up to his full height,
and, grasping his club in both hands, brought it
down with tremendous force squarely between
the cougar’s eyes. Stunned and bleeding, the
animal had received all the punishment it could
stand for the present, and, still spitting furiously,
it backed down the tree and leaped to the ground.</p>

<p>The boys were panting and well-nigh exhausted,
but they still had strength left for a cheer as they
gazed down at their discomfited enemy.</p>

<p>“That was hot work while it lasted,” panted
Fred. “If it hadn’t been for that scheme of
yours, Bobby, it would probably have been a
different story.”</p>

<p>“It did help some,” admitted Bobby. “But
we’re not through with that brute yet. You can
see he’s working himself up to come after us
again.”</p>

<p>“I’ve got to get another club,” said Fred, as he
started hacking at a stout branch with his knife.
“I don’t know how I ever kept from falling when
he knocked that stick out of my hand.”</p>

<p>“It was lucky he connected with the club instead
of with your hand,” remarked Lee. “You’d better
get that branch cut as quickly as you can.
That beast will be up here again inside of five
minutes.”</p>

<p>“All right, I’m ready for him,” said Fred, as he
cut through the last tough fibre and found himself
provided with a serviceable club. “We can give
him the same dose he got before.”</p>

<p>The cougar was still full of fight, and Fred had
hardly regained his position when the fierce brute
came swarming up the tree again. But this time
he did not stop at the screen of branches, most of
which had been torn off in the previous struggle,
and in spite of a staggering fusillade of blows he
managed to reach the crotch in which the boys
were standing.</p>

<p>“Out onto the branches, fellows!” yelled Lee.
“It’s our only chance!”</p>

<p>Before the panther could get his balance and
reach one of them, the boys had scrambled out on
three separate branches, leaving the cougar in undisputed
possession of their former vantage
ground.</p>

<p>It was a breathless moment for all three, as they
waited to see which one the animal would attack
first. The cougar himself seemed undecided at
first, glaring from one to the other, spitting and
growling, viciously. Then, perhaps because he
had happened to choose the largest branch, the
ferocious beast started creeping toward Lee, his
wicked yellow eyes staring fixedly at his victim.</p>

<p>“Help me out, fellows, or I’m a goner!” cried
the Southern lad despairingly.</p>

<p>His friends had no intention of leaving him to
his fate. Some three feet above Lee’s branch
were two others, almost parallel to it. Bobby
and Fred, both moved by the same thought, selected
each a branch and crawled cautiously out in
the wake of the advancing cougar.</p>

<p>The latter was proceeding cautiously, for the
branch bent and swayed with his weight, and anyway,
his prey seemed so securely within his reach
that he saw no cause for hurry. He was so intent
on Lee that he either did not notice the swaying
of the branches over his head or else thought
it not worth noticing. Lee kept edging further
and further out on the branch, until at last the
cougar, feeling it bend perilously beneath him,
paused a moment in his deadly progress. This
was Bobby’s and Fred’s opportunity, and they
were not slow in taking advantage of it. They
poised their clubs a second, and then, at the same
time, brought them down full force on the wicked
yellow head beneath them.</p>

<p>No panther that ever lived could withstand that
crushing impact, and the cougar went limp, lost
his hold on the branch, and went crashing to the
ground, twenty feet below, where he lay twitching
convulsively.</p>

<p>“Now’s our chance to make an end of this customer
for once and all!” yelled Bobby. “Come
on down, fellows, and we’ll finish him this
time.”</p>

<p>Lee hastily scrambled back from the end of the
branch, and all three boys slid down the trunk of
the tree to where the cougar lay, still stunned from
the terrific blow and from its fall.</p>

<p>“Quick,” said Bobby, “grab hold of him, and
we’ll throw him into that big bog-hole we passed
when we left the main path.”</p>

<p>“Right!” exclaimed Fred. “But we’ll have to
act mighty quick. He’s apt to come to life any
second.”</p>

<p>It was all the boys could do to lift the big
brute, but, with the strength of desperation, they
managed it somehow, and half carried, half
dragged, the unconscious panther to the slimy
green pit that they had almost tumbled into themselves
while making for the tree. The pit was surrounded
by an expanse of treacherous quicksand,
and into this they shoved the cougar. The greedy
quicksand received its victim with avidity, drawing
the cougar down and down into its slimy
depths, until with a dull sucking sound it closed
over the bloodthirsty brute’s head.</p>

<p>The boys watched, fascinated, and almost found
it in their hearts to pity their late enemy. He
was gone as completely as though he had never
existed, and the treacherous sand stretched out
smooth and unbroken, not a quiver on its surface
to tell that it had added one more victim to its
already long list.</p>

<p>“Gee,” exclaimed Bobby with a shudder,
“that’s a terrible way to die, although that brute
deserved all that was coming to him.”</p>

<p>“Well, it’s pretty certain that he won’t bother
us any more,” remarked Fred. “And I think
we’re mighty lucky to be alive.”</p>

<p>“I’ll say so!” exclaimed Lee, fervently. “I
gave myself up for lost when I found myself out
on that limb with the panther not ten feet away
from me. That was an awful wallop you fellows
gave him.”</p>

<p>“A wallop in time saves nine,” misquoted Fred,
with a grin.</p>

<p>“It probably saved the nine that the cougar was
figuring on giving me,” said Lee.</p>

<p>“Looks to me as though that wallop lost nine,”
said Bobby, slyly.</p>

<p>“How do you make that out?” inquired Fred.</p>

<p>“Why, it lost that big cat’s nine lives, didn’t
it?” inquired Bobby, innocently.</p>

<p>“It certainly did,” admitted Lee, laughing,
“and you can bet I was in a position to appreciate
it, too. The business end of that panther was getting
entirely too close to me for comfort.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Fred, “it must be Bobby’s turn
next to get in a tight place. First I nearly get
eaten up by an alligator, and then Lee pretty near
furnishes a hearty meal for a hungry cougar.
What variety of animals do you prefer, Bobby?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m not jealous of all the attention you
fellows get,” returned Bobby. “You can have
your little pets and welcome.”</p>

<p>“How generous he is, Lee, isn’t he?” said
Fred, sarcastically. “But don’t forget the old
saying, Bobby, that ‘he who laughs last, irritates.’”</p>

<p>“That must be a mighty old saying, all right—so
old that everybody’s forgotten it but you,”
said Bobby.</p>

<p>“That just goes to show what a fine memory
I have,” retorted Fred. “Whenever you can’t
remember an old proverb, you try to make out
that there never was such a one. Your memory
is nothing but a hole with no bottom in it.”</p>

<p>“All right, pick on my memory all you want
to,” grinned Bobby, “but remember ‘it’s a long
worm that has no turning.’”</p>

<p>“You fellows had better cut out all those fake
proverbs and get down to business,” warned Lee.
“We’re just as far as ever from getting out of
this swamp, and we don’t even know where we’re
going to get our next meal. Why don’t you exercise
your minds on this problem: when do we
eat, and if so, how?”</p>

<p>“You certainly start off with a terribly hard
one,” said Fred. “Can’t you think of anything
easier than that, Lee?”</p>

<p>“I’m getting so hungry that I can’t think of
anything else. It’s hours since the last of those
alligator eggs disappeared,” complained Lee.</p>

<p>“Then you shouldn’t have thrown the cougar
into the quicksand,” retorted Fred, “he might
have made tough eating, but it would have been
a lot better than nothing.”</p>

<p>“I thought of that,” admitted Lee. “But I
was more anxious to keep him from eating me.
Besides,” he added, “you and Bobby never
thought of anything but getting rid of him at that
time either.”</p>

<p>“No use crying over spilt milk,” said Bobby,
philosophically. “We’ll have to move and trust
to luck for something to eat.”</p>

<p>As neither of the others had anything better to
suggest, they plodded back to the path they had
been following when they were so rudely interrupted
by the cougar. The haze had lightened
considerably, and the sun shone through with the
appearance of a big red ball, enabling the boys
to pick their way for a short time, but then the
haze settled down thicker than ever, and they
found themselves entirely at a loss. Their only
consolation was that the ground appeared to be
getting steadily higher and firmer, and they felt
that they had left the worst of the bog behind
them. But the faint path they had been following
grew less and less distinct, and before they fairly
realized it they were hopelessly lost. For a time
they stumbled on through a maze of vines and
creepers that grew steadily thicker, until at last
they became practically impassable. Then the
boys were forced to call a halt, and they gazed
at each other questioningly.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXV<br/>THE HUNTER’S CABIN</h2>

<p class='first'>Such a predicament would have discouraged
older hearts than theirs. The long wandering in
the swamp, the fight with the alligator and then
one with the cougar, and after all to find themselves
apparently no nearer deliverance than
when they started—it was a bitter pill to swallow.</p>

<p>But no one of the boys was of the kind that
accepts defeat easily, and after the first pang of
something akin to despair had vanished, they
pulled themselves together and faced the situation
bravely.</p>

<p>“We’re a long way from being licked yet,”
declared Bobby. “We’ll have to go back a way,
and keep our eyes open for some sign of a path
leading off from the one we used to get here.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but if there had been, one, we’d probably
have seen it as we came along,” objected Fred.</p>

<p>“But on the other hand,” argued Bobby, “we
didn’t know then that this path would lead us
into nothing at all, the way it has, and we weren’t
keeping such a sharp lookout for something better.
At any rate, seeing that we can’t fly over the
tops of these trees, it seems to me that’s our only
chance.”</p>

<p>“Looks that way to me, too,” agreed Lee, “and
the quicker we go the better, because it’s going
to get dark within another two hours.”</p>

<p>“All right, then,” said Bobby, decisively,
“right about face, and we’ll be on our way.”</p>

<p>They had gone about a mile, and were beginning
to give up all hope of ever getting out of
their predicament, when suddenly Bobby came
to an abrupt halt.</p>

<p>Some ten feet off the narrow track they were
on, stood two giant boulders, close together, with
hardly room between them for a grown man to
squeeze through. The boys had hardly noticed
them when they had passed them going in the
other direction, but now Bobby’s keen young eyes
had seen some sign on one of them that caused
his heart to leap. He ran over to the larger of
the two boulders to verify his discovery, and
there, sure enough, almost erased by the wind
and weather but still perfectly plain to keen eyes,
was the outline of an arrow rudely daubed on the
face of the rock.</p>

<p>“But it seems to be pointing right between the
rocks,” said Lee, as all three boys bent over the
faint outline.</p>

<p>“Sure it is,” said Bobby, excitedly, “and right
between the rocks is exactly where we’re going
next,” and without further words he forced his
way through the bushes that choked the narrow
gap between the rocks, Fred and Lee following
close at his heels.</p>

<p>Bobby glanced quickly about him, and was not
long in finding what he sought. There was a
small semi-circle of gravel and shale at the back
of the boulders, and at the edge of this little clearing,
faint but unmistakable, was a narrow path
leading into the dense undergrowth.</p>

<p>“Hooray!” shouted Bobby. “This is the first
sign of anything promising we’ve seen since
Boolus stole our boat, and I’ll bet Meena’s crullers
to crocodile eggs that this path will lead us
out to civilization.”</p>

<p>Fred and Lee were equally excited, and with
renewed hope they entered the narrow path and
pressed forward, making little of the vines and
fallen tree trunks that retarded their progress.</p>

<p>Night was descending rapidly, and in the heavy
woods it was almost dark when, panting and
spent, the three boys staggered out into a little
clearing, and before them could just make out
the outlines of a rude log cabin, almost covered
by vines.</p>

<p>“Thank Heaven!” exclaimed Lee. “I was beginning
to think we’d have to spend another
night in the swamp, and I’ve had enough of that
to last me some time.”</p>

<p>The others were hardly less relieved. The
cabin at least would shelter them and keep out
marauders like the cougar, and they felt sure
that in the morning they would find a path leading
from it to the outer world.</p>

<p>There was no sign of life about the cabin, and
the door opened readily enough when they raised
the latch by which it was fastened. The interior
was pitch dark, but Bobby lit one of his few remaining
matches, and by its feeble light they
peered about the little place.</p>

<p>“Here’s luck,” exclaimed Fred, and from a
dusty shelf reached down one of several long tallow
candles. “Whoever left them there must
have known we’d be along and would need them.”</p>

<p>“Whoever left them there, did it a long while
ago,” said Lee. “Look how thick everything is
with dust!”</p>

<p>“Well, you could hardly expect him to stay here
and keep things clean for us,” grinned Fred.
“That’s asking too much, Lee.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m not kicking,” disclaimed Lee. “This
place looks solid enough to keep the rain out, and
maybe if we look around we’ll find other things
besides the candles.”</p>

<p>“I’ve heard of Eskimos eating candles,” said
Bobby, “and I’m pretty nearly hungry enough to
try one myself.”</p>

<p>“Well, you tried the alligator eggs first, so you
ought to be willing to sample these too,” said
Fred.</p>

<p>“Maybe I will, at that,” said Bobby, “but not
until I’ve made sure there isn’t anything else to
be had.”</p>

<p>“There seems to be a closet of some kind over
there,” said Fred, pointing to the opposite wall.
“Let’s see what’s in it.”</p>

<p>“Probably nothing but a large amount of air,”
said Lee, sceptically.</p>

<p>“Well, there’s only one way to find out, and
that’s to look,” said Fred, and, suiting the action
to the word, he strode quickly across the room
and opened the door of the closet.</p>

<p>“Scubbity-yow!” yelled Fred. “Look at that,
will you!”</p>

<p>Neatly ranged on shelves were cans of meat
and vegetables, sufficient to feed the boys for
weeks, if the necessity arose.</p>

<p>“Gee!” exclaimed Bobby. “It doesn’t look as
though we’d have to eat candles yet awhile, does
it?”</p>

<p>“I should say not,” said Lee, jubilantly. “And
there’s a big pot in the corner too,” he cried, a
moment later. “I reckon whoever provisioned
this cabin must have intended to stay here a
while.”</p>

<p>“Looks like it, all right,” agreed Bobby. “But
let’s get busy and open one or two of those cans.
How would you fellows like some baked beans?”
he inquired, looking over the labels. “Think you
could punish them in a proper manner?”</p>

<p>“Lead us to it,” yelled Fred, and Lee rubbed
his stomach in a most expressive manner. Whoever
had provided the food had been so far neglectful
as to forget the convenient can opener,
but Bobby’s jacknife proved a convenient substitute,
and it did not take them long to get a fire
going in the rough grate that decorated one end
of the little cabin. As the odor of frying pork
and beans filled the air, the boys could hardly restrain
themselves until they were heated through,
and when at length Bobby pronounced the feast
ready, they fell on it like so many wolves.</p>

</div>

<div id='chXXVI' class='chapter'>
<h2>CHAPTER XXVI<br/>A MIDNIGHT PROWLER</h2>

<p class='first'>“Yum yum!” exclaimed Fred, “I’ve eaten lots
of beans in my short lifetime, but never any that
tasted half as good as these.”</p>

<p>“They are just about what the doctor ordered,”
conceded Bobby.</p>

<p>“And when we get through these, how would a
nice can of peaches taste?” put in Lee.</p>

<p>“Scubbity-yow!” shouted Fred. “Peaches,
did you say? Say, I think I’d be contented to
spend the rest of my life here. Bobby, we certainly
owe you a vote of thanks for getting us here
the way you did.”</p>

<p>“It was mostly luck,” disclaimed Bobby. “If
I hadn’t happened to notice that arrow on the rock
we’d be wandering around in the cold, cold world
yet, probably.”</p>

<p>“Well, after all the hard luck we’ve had, I think
we had a little good luck coming to us,” said Lee.</p>

<p>“Looks as though we had it, for the time being,
anyway,” replied Bobby, as he sawed away at the
can of peaches. “Here, you fellows pass your
cups and I’ll fill them up with something that will
make your hair curl.”</p>

<p>His friends were not slow in accepting this invitation,
and they ate the luscious fruit with an
appreciation sharpened by the privations they
had been through. As Bobby remarked, “nobody
knew how good things were until they hadn’t
been able to get them for awhile.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know about you energetic Indians,”
said Lee, when he had finished his peaches with
a sigh, half of contentment and half of regret that
they were gone, “but I’m just going to lie on the
floor in front of that fire and loaf for awhile,”
and suiting the action to the word, he threw
himself down full length on the floor.</p>

<p>“I don’t know how Bobby feels,” said Fred,
stretching luxuriously, “but I don’t think I’d
mind a little rest myself. Most of that energy
Lee’s talking about seems to have oozed out of
me, someway.”</p>

<p>“Same here,” admitted Bobby. “And it’s
funny, too. Outside of fighting alligators and
panthers and ducking mudholes and quicksands,
we haven’t really been doing anything the last
few days.”</p>

<p>“A little more of this,” remarked Fred, “and
a football game will seem quiet and restful. We’ll
be going to sleep in the middle of it.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know about that,” said Bobby, “but I
do know that it won’t be very long before I get
to sleep to-night.”</p>

<p>“I suppose that whoever owns this cabin won’t
thank us for eating his food,” went on Fred, as
all three boys lay luxuriously at ease and gazed
into the radiant heart of the fire.</p>

<p>“If we ever get out of this wilderness, I’ll
find out who the place belongs to, and we’ll pay
him for what we take,” said Lee; “I know if it
were mine, I wouldn’t grudge the food to any one
who needed it as badly as we did.”</p>

<p>“I wonder who <i>does</i> own it,” speculated Bobby.</p>

<p>“I haven’t any idea,” admitted Lee, “but lots
of the people around here keep places like this
for hunting, and I suppose that’s what it’s been
used for.”</p>

<p>“Nobody would have to hunt very long around
here before he found something, it seems to me,”
said Bobby. “It seems as though it were the
other way around, and the animals come and
hunt us.”</p>

<p>“Well, that doesn’t matter, as long as they don’t
get us,” said Lee, “and I guess we’re as safe in
this cabin as we would be sleeping at Rockledge.”</p>

<p>“Yes, or safer, in one way,” said Fred. “If the
cabin should catch fire, all we’d have to do would
be to open the door and walk out, while when the
school caught fire we didn’t have it quite so
easy.”</p>

<p>“That’s true enough,” agreed Bobby. “But
while we’re talking of this place being safe, I
vote we fasten the door better than it is now.
There’s nothing but a latch holding it, and I’d feel
safer it we could make it a little more secure.”</p>

<p>“We might jam a chair against it,” suggested
Fred, “the floor is pretty uneven, and we could
jam the chair in between one of the planks and
the door, so that an elephant would have a hard
job getting in.”</p>

<p>“That’s certainly the way we want it,” said
Lee, laughing. “The harder it is to get that door
open, the better I’ll sleep.”</p>

<p>“Wow!” exclaimed Fred, with a tremendous
yawn. “Speaking of sleep, let’s fix things up and
go to sleep. I feel as though I could win the long
distance sleeping championship without half trying.”</p>

<p>“You’ll have to go some to beat me out,”
laughed Bobby, scrambling to his feet. “Let’s
see if Fred’s plan to fasten the door will work.”</p>

<p>“Nothing surer in the world,” boasted Fred,
“just watch me.”</p>

<p>Just in front of the door one floor board was
warped so that it was perhaps half an inch higher
than those alongside it. The cabin was equipped
with three rude but very strong chairs, and seizing
one of these, Fred jammed it in between the
door and the uneven board so that any one or anything
attempting to enter would have to tear up
the floor before it could gain admittance.</p>

<p>“There!” exclaimed Fred, stepping back to
view his handiwork, “I guess any one that wants
to come in here now will have to ask our permission
first.”</p>

<p>The windows of the little cabin were small and
criss-crossed with stout scantlings, so there was
no chance of any denizen of the woods making
them an unwelcome visit by means of that route.
It was Lee who suggested the only remaining possibility.</p>

<p>“I wonder if any friends of that cougar could
get down the chimney,” he speculated.</p>

<p>“We’ll soon see,” said Bobby, crossing over to
the fireplace. He glanced in under the hood that
projected from the fireplace to keep the smoke
out of the room.</p>

<p>“I don’t think there’s any chance of that,” he
stated. “The flue isn’t more than eight or ten
inches square, and anything that could get down
there couldn’t do us much damage. Besides, the
fire will be going most of the night, and I guess
that would do the trick, even if the chimney were
four times as big as it is now.”</p>

<p>Reassured on this point, the boys threw more
wood on the fire, for the sake of light as well as
warmth, and selected their bunks for the night.
There were four of these built against the wall
opposite the fireplace, and they were filled with
twigs and dead leaves, making a comfortable
enough bed for those who were tired enough not
to be particular about where they slept.</p>

<p>“I guess there’s not much choice,” said Bobby,
“so I’ll just tumble into the one nearest me.”
Which he proceeded forthwith to do. The others
each selected a bunk, and followed his example.</p>

<p>The fire crackling cheerily on the hearth made
the cabin pleasantly warm, and the boys were just
dropping off to sleep when they were suddenly
brought back to wakefulness with a jerk by a
stealthy scratching sound at the door, followed
by a low growl. For a few seconds after this
there was silence, and then the boys could hear
the door creak as some strong body pushed against
it.</p>

<p>Thanks to the strong barricade against it, however,
the stout door defied the efforts of the would-be
intruder, and the boys, sitting up in their
bunks with every sense alert, could hear the soft
pad-pad of feet encircling the cabin. Then there
was a sudden fierce scrambling and scratching,
and the beast, whatever it was, was on the roof.
It prowled restlessly about, stopping every now
and then to tear at the roof with rasping claws.
But the cabin was constructed in stout fashion,
and was not to be entered so easily.</p>

<p>“What do you suppose it can be, fellows?”
questioned Lee in a low voice, which trembled a
little in spite of himself. “Do you think it can
be another cougar?”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t be surprised,” whispered Bobby.
“Maybe it’s the mate of the one that we killed
to-day. She may have tracked us to get revenge.”</p>

<p>“I’ll bet that’s just what it is!” cried Fred.
“Suppose we had had to sleep in the woods to-night.
We’d be goners, sure.”</p>

<p>The others nodded, and they all three listened
to see what the night prowler would do next. The
brute examined every foot of the roof, and the
boys could hear it sniffing suspiciously at the
chimney. They blessed the man who had constructed
the cabin with such a wary eye for such
contingencies, and congratulated each other on
being safe within instead of out in the woods and
practically at the mercy of the savage brute.</p>

<p>The beast overhead finally seemed to come to
the conclusion that it could not get in from the
roof, and it leaped to the ground and the boys
could hear it going away. For a long time they
listened for it to come back, but it did not, and
at last, far away, they heard the same wild scream
they had heard while on the island in the swamp,
but this time there seemed to be a note of grief as
well as ferocity in the cry. It rose, cut wailingly
through the darkness, and then died away.</p>

<p>For a long time the boys sat tense and expectant,
not knowing at what moment the beast might
return. But as nothing further happened, drowsiness
at last overcame them, and after throwing
a fresh supply of fuel on the fire, they dropped
off into deep slumber, from which they were only
awakened by a golden shaft of sunshine that
pierced in through one of the little windows.</p>

<p>“Gee,” said Bobby, sitting up and rubbing the
sleep out of his eyes, “I feel fit for anything now,
and hungry enough to eat nails. It’s your turn
to cook, Fred. Hustle around and see if you can
get breakfast as well as I got supper last night.”</p>

<p>“Huh! I’ll show you what real cooking is like,”
said Fred, leaping out of his bunk. “What shall
it be—humming-birds’ tongues or bird’s-nest
soup?”</p>

<p>“I think I’d rather have some bacon, if it’s all
the same to you,” said Bobby, with mock seriousness.
“There’s a fresh jar of it in the closet.”</p>

<p>“Oh, well, if you’d rather have ordinary, everyday
bacon,” said Fred, “I’ll have to give it to
you, I suppose,” and he soon had some appetizing
slices sizzling in the pan.</p>

<p>“That cougar last night seems like a bad dream
now,” remarked Lee. “I don’t mind admitting
I felt mighty nervous while he was prowling
around.”</p>

<p>“I guess none of us exactly enjoyed it,” returned
Bobby. “But it may not have been a
cougar at all. Maybe it was only a wildcat.”</p>

<p>“Possibly,” said Lee, doubtfully, and Fred terminated
further discussion at this point by serving
out the crisp bacon, together with some hardtack
that he had fried in the grease. This was
soon eaten, and after Fred had been complimented
on his cooking, the boys cautiously unfastened the
door, and, seeing no signs of the beast, whatever
it was, that had disturbed them the previous
night, ventured forth to explore their surroundings.</p>

</div>

<div id='chXXVII' class='chapter'>
<h2>CHAPTER XXVII<br/>THE MOCCASIN SNAKE</h2>

<p class='first'>The hearty breakfast and the bright sunshine,
added to the consciousness that they had found a
shelter to which they might retreat in case of
need put new zest into the boys, and they felt
much more hopeful and lighthearted than they
had twenty-four hours earlier.</p>

<p>“Somehow I have a hunch that this is going
to be a lucky day for us,” remarked Bobby, as he
led the way.</p>

<p>“Here’s hoping that you’re right,” said Lee.
“We’re certainly about due for a change in fortune.
Poor mother!” he added, anxiety coming
into his eyes, “she must be worried to death.
It’s safe to say she hasn’t slept a wink since we’ve
been gone. I’ve no doubt she has searching
parties out looking for us, but in this swamp they
might hunt for days without coming across us.”</p>

<p>“We’ll trust in Bobby’s hunch,” Fred encouraged
him. “They’ve often come out all right.
I think he’s got a rabbit’s foot hidden about him
somewhere.”</p>

<p>“If I had, we’d been out of this swamp long
before this,” laughed Bobby. “Now,” he went
on, “there’s one thing we’ve got to do, and it’s
more important than anything else. Wherever
we go, we’ve got to know how to find our way back
to this cabin. In the first place, it’s the only safe
place to spend the night. Then the very fact it’s
here shows that parties come to it sometimes and
we may have the luck of falling in with them.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Fred, “that’s good advice. But
how are we going to do it?”</p>

<p>“By using this,” replied Bobby, showing him a
small hatchet that he had fastened to his belt.
“I found this in one corner of the cabin this morning
and I brought it along. We’ll chip off pieces
of bark from the trees as we go along and that
will help us to find our way back.”</p>

<p>He illustrated this by slashing a bit of bark off
a tree that they happened to be passing.</p>

<p>“That’s bully,” said Lee, greatly relieved. “I
was just worrying about the chance of not being
able to find our way back again.”</p>

<p>They went on, looking carefully for some sign
of a trail, by following which they might again
reach the plantation and friends.</p>

<p>Soon they found themselves on marshier ground
than that near the cabin, and they turned in another
direction to find better footing.</p>

<p>The ground was covered with rotting leaves
and bits of broken branches. Fred was picking
his way, and was just about to step on what
seemed to be an unusually thick stick, about three
feet long, when there was a warning shout from
Lee who was several feet in the rear.</p>

<p>“Look out, Fred!” he yelled. “It’s a snake, a
moccasin!”</p>

<p>The warning came too late. Fred’s foot had
already touched one end of the seeming stick.
Like lightning, an ugly head upreared at the other
end and struck savagely at the intruder.</p>

<p>“Run!” shouted Lee. “Run for your life!”</p>

<p>Fred obeyed and ran as fast as the marshy
nature of the ground permitted. The snake pursued
him gliding through the tussocks, his baleful
eyes like two flaming points.</p>

<p>Bobby had turned at Lee’s cry, and in a moment
had grasped the situation. He had the hatchet
in his hand and threw it with all his might at the
snake, that was now close on Fred’s heels. He
had no time to take careful aim, but by great good
fortune the sharp blade struck the reptile a little
behind the neck. It stopped instantly and
writhed about, beating the ground and hissing
horribly.</p>

<p>Lee in the meantime had picked up a club, and
with a few blows from this put an end to the
snake. Then he and Bobby hurried to their comrade,
who had seated himself on the trunk of a
fallen tree, pale and panting.</p>

<p>“Did he bite you, Fred?” cried Bobby, his
heart convulsed with fear for his chum.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid he did,” replied Fred, in a tone
that he tried to keep firm. “He gave an awful
dig at my foot.”</p>

<p>In a moment Bobby was on his knees and was
taking off Fred’s shoe. There were tiny holes
in it where the snake’s fangs had penetrated.
The stocking too was torn, and Bobby’s heart
sank as he stripped it off.</p>

<p>But a great wave of thankfulness swept over
him when he saw that the skin was not broken.
He looked it over most carefully, but there was
not even a scratch. By the narrowest of chances,
Fred had escaped. His stout shoe had saved him.</p>

<p>“You’re all right, old boy,” said Bobby, though
his voice trembled. “That snake came mighty
near doing for you but didn’t quite make it.”</p>

<p>Fred almost collapsed as he realized that he
was safe, for he had feared the worst.</p>

<p>“If he had struck above the shoe top it would
have been good-night,” said Lee, who shared to
the full the joy and relief of his friends. “Those
moccasins are the deadliest snakes of the South.
People are more afraid of them than of rattlesnakes.
A rattlesnake will give warning, but a
moccasin never does. Then too a rattlesnake is
only too glad to get away from you if you will
let him, but the moccasin will chase you, just as
this one did. My, but you had a narrow escape.
The snake was gaining on you and would have
wound himself around your leg in another minute
and then it would have been all over with you.”</p>

<p>Bobby brought a little water from a pool near
by and carefully washed the stocking, scrubbing
the shoe also, to remove any trace of the
poison that there might be on them. Then after
they had partially dried, Fred put them on and
they all went over to look at the hideous reptile.
It lay perfectly still and there was no doubt that
it was dead, but to make assurance doubly sure,
Bobby recovered his hatchet that lay a few feet
away and with one stroke struck off the moccasin’s
head.</p>

<p>“Gee, he’s an ugly looking sinner,” murmured
Fred.</p>

<p>“Sure is,” agreed his chums in unison.</p>

</div>

<div id='chXXVIII' class='chapter'>
<h2>CHAPTER XXVIII<br/>A GREAT DISCOVERY</h2>

<p class='first'>Now that the snake was certainly beyond the
possibility of doing them further harm, the boys
could inspect it at their leisure. But even in
death the venomous reptile inspired them with
horror. Fred shuddered as he looked at him and
thought of what might have been if the snake
had struck a little harder or had overtaken him
in that desperate chase.</p>

<p>It was about a yard in length, and the body
was strong and thick. The short tail was provided
with a row of shields and there was a horny
appendage at the end. The long triangular
head had shallow pits on the nose and the mouth
was very wide. The color was a coppery brown
and there were reddish brown bands on the sides
that became wider on the lower end of the body,
giving an appearance something like moccasins,
and from these the snake derived its name.</p>

<p>What the boys specially noticed was a white
band that ran round the creature’s mouth.</p>

<p>“That’s what gives it the other name it’s known
by,” explained Lee. “People call it the cotton
mouth, because that white streak looks like cotton.”</p>

<p>“It’s the ugliest thing I ever saw!” exclaimed
Fred. “I only hope I never see another. You bet
that I’m going to watch my step for the rest of
the time we’re in this swamp.”</p>

<p>“Once we get out of this, you’re not likely to see
one again,” Lee assured him. “They’re mostly
found in wet, marshy places and I’ve never seen
one on dry parts of the plantation. There are
plenty of them in the low-lying rice fields, and the
darkeys stand in deadly fear of them.”</p>

<p>“I don’t blame them,” remarked Bobby.
“But come now, fellows, let’s get along. There’s
nothing to keep us here any longer, unless,” he
added with a laugh, “Fred wants to take this
fellow’s head along as a souvenir.”</p>

<p>“Not on your life!” declared Fred emphatically.
“I’ll see that head often enough in my
dreams as it is. Gee, Bobby,” he continued with
a sigh of relief, “it was a mighty lucky thing you
had that hatchet along with you.”</p>

<p>“And luckier yet that he threw it just right,”
put in Lee. “That’s what comes from being a
good ball player. One learns how to throw.”</p>

<p>“Don’t give me any credit for that,” protested
Bobby. “I might just as well have hit him with
the handle instead of the blade. Luck sure was
with us.”</p>

<p>They left the loathsome reptile and made their
way to higher ground, picking their steps with
exceeding care and avoiding as they would the
plague anything that looked like a thick stick.</p>

<p>Bobby was going ahead as fast as the tangled
vines and shrubbery would let him, when he gave
an exclamation and fell to his knees.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” asked his companions
in alarm, running up to him.</p>

<p>“Stubbed my toe on something hard,” explained
Bobby, rising to his feet and brushing
himself off, “and barked my shins in the bargain
as I went down. Kicked against a stone, I imagine.”</p>

<p>“That’s funny,” said Lee. “There are mighty
few stones around here. It must have been a
stump.”</p>

<p>“Well, it doesn’t matter much,” replied Bobby.
“It brought me down all right, whether it was
wood or stone. But just for curiosity, I’m going
to find out.”</p>

<p>He kicked away the grass and twigs and bent
down to look.</p>

<p>“Why, that’s queer!” he exclaimed. “It’s
stone, as I thought, but it isn’t a rock. It’s been
shaped with a chisel and it looks as though it
had figures or letters on it.”</p>

<p>“How on earth did a thing like that get here?”
asked Fred, in a puzzled tone.</p>

<p>“I can make out something like the letter C,”
said Bobby. “C-A-R-T——why, Lee, I believe
it’s your name!”</p>

<p>The next instant he leaped to his feet, as the
full significance of his discovery flashed upon him.</p>

<p>“Hurrah!” he shouted. “Glory hallelujah!
Lee, we’ve found one of the boundary stones of
your mother’s property.”</p>

<p>“What?” cried Lee, all a-tremble with excitement.</p>

<p>“Are you sure?” queried Fred, dropping on
hands and knees beside his friend.</p>

<p>“It sure looks like it,” affirmed Bobby, digging
away like mad to uncover more of the stone.</p>

<p>The others followed his example and made the
dirt fly, for all the world, as Fred said afterward,
“like dogs digging out a woodchuck.”</p>

<p>A few minutes of hard work, and enough of
the stone was uncovered to permit them to make
out the inscription. It was time-stained and
weatherbeaten, but read as follows:</p>

<p class='in2'>
S.E. <i>Limit of property of</i> N. CARTIER, <i>Laboulaye
Parish, La.</i>
</p>

<p>Then followed some surveyor’s signs and symbols,
which to the boys were like so much Greek.
Underneath these however was an arrow pointing
in a certain direction, and Bobby studied this for
several minutes with great attention.</p>

<p>“What do you make of it?” asked Fred curiously,
as he noted his friend’s puckered brow.</p>

<p>“This arrow means something,” replied Bobby,
“and I think we’d better follow in the direction
in which it points. I tell you what we do. You
stand here, Fred, and Lee and I will follow the
line of the arrow. If you see us getting out of
line, you wave to us and set us right.”</p>

<p>This was agreed to, and Bobby and Lee set out.
They had gone a distance of perhaps two hundred
yards, when Bobby’s keen eyes saw a rim of stone
just projecting above the ground. They cleared
away the moss and rubbish about it and found
that it was another landmark, practically the same
as the first, except that in this case the arrow
pointed slightly in another direction, showing
that the boundary line veered at that point.</p>

<p>They shouted to Fred and he quickly rejoined
them.</p>

<p>“Now,” said Bobby jubilantly, “the rest will
be easy. All we’ve got to do is to report the location
of these two stones and a surveying party
can go from stone to stone and so trace out the
whole boundary line of the property.”</p>

<p>“Look!” exclaimed Fred suddenly, pointing to
the right.</p>

<p>They looked and saw a figure just vanishing
behind a tree.</p>

</div>

<div id='chXXIX' class='chapter'>
<h2>CHAPTER XXIX<br/>’RASTUS ABIMELECH BELSHAZZAR JOHNSON</h2>

<p class='first'>“Who can that be?” asked Fred, as the startled
boys focused their eyes on the tree.</p>

<p>“Search me,” replied Bobby. “But whoever
it is, we want to talk to him right away. It isn’t
likely he intends any harm, and maybe he’ll know
a way to get out of this swamp.”</p>

<p>“More likely he’s lost in it, just the same as
ourselves,” conjectured Fred, but followed Bobby
and Lee who had already started in the direction
of the tree.</p>

<p>When they were within twenty feet of it, they
halted.</p>

<p>“Hello there!” sang out Bobby. “Come out
from behind that tree, please. We want to talk
to you.”</p>

<p>A woolly head peered cautiously around the
side of the tree and then a diminutive darkey boy
appeared in full view.</p>

<p>Recognition on both sides was instantaneous.</p>

<p>“Why,” cried Lee, “that’s the boy who fell
overboard on the way down from New York, the
one that Bobby saved by throwing him the life
preserver!”</p>

<p>“The one with the long name!” exclaimed
Fred. “Let’s see, it was—”</p>

<p>“’Rastus Abimelech Belshazzar Johnson,” finished
the little darkey proudly, with a grin that
showed all his white teeth. “An’ Ah sure am
spifflicated to meet all you young gem’mun agin,
speshul dis one what saved mah life,” indicating
Bobby.</p>

<p>“Maybe you can do the same for us now,” said
Bobby. “We’re lost in this swamp. Do you
know the way out?”</p>

<p>“Ah sho will,” replied ’Rastus, and a moment
flash of his gleaming ivories. “Ah wuz bo’n an’
brung up only a few miles fum heah. Reckon Ah
cud fin’ mah way fru dis yeah swamp wiv mah
eyes shet.”</p>

<p>This was indeed good news to the boys, who felt
as if a thousand tons had been lifted from their
hearts.</p>

<p>“Fac’ is,” continued ’Rastus, “Ah cum along
wiv a pahty what wuz lookin’ fur you-all. Dey’s
only a little way fum heah, an’ Ah specs Ah’d
better go an’ info’mation dem dat you-all ez
heah.”</p>

<p>“You bet you would,” cried Lee. “Hurry up,
’Rastus, and you’ll find that this was the best
day’s work you ever did.”</p>

<p>“’Rastus is going to be our Moses to lead us
out of the wilderness,” cried Fred gleefully.</p>

<p>“Mah name ain’t Moses,” replied their deliverer.
“It am ’Rastus Abimelech Belshazzar
Johnson.”</p>

<p>“And a mighty good name it is,” said Bobby,
“and one that we’ll always remember. But now
let’s see how quick you’ll be in finding the other
people and bringing them here.”</p>

<p>“Ah sho will,” replied ’Rastus, and a moment
later he had vanished like a shadow among the
vines and tree trunks.</p>

<p>“Thank heaven,” cried Lee as they looked after
his retreating figure. “Before night we’ll all
be back in the home that I began to fear we’d
never see again.”</p>

<p>“It’s glorious,” agreed Bobby, “but after all,
perhaps it’s all for the best that we’ve had to stay
in the swamp as long as we have. If help had
come yesterday, for instance, we wouldn’t have
found the boundary stones. That’s paid us for
all the trouble and danger we’ve been through.”</p>

<p>In a few minutes they heard the sound of voices,
and soon a party of four men came in sight, with
’Rastus Abimelech Belshazzar Johnson proudly
leading the way.</p>

<p>There were broad smiles on their faces as the
boys rushed forward to meet them and it was hard
to tell which group was the more delighted. All
talked together, and there was a general hubbub
until the excitement quieted down a little.</p>

<p>The leader of the party was a Mr. Lanfranc,
the Parish Clerk of that section, a big, bluff, genial
man, who was a great friend of the Cartier
family.</p>

<p>“I can’t tell you how relieved we are to find
you boys,” he said, as he slapped Lee affectionately
on the shoulder. “We’ve been beating the
swamp for you for the last two days. But it
covers so many miles of territory that it’s almost
like looking for a needle in a haystack. But
thank God that we’ve found you at last, alive and
well. Your poor mother has been almost crazy
about you. Here, ’Rastus,” he continued, turning
to the little darkey who stood by, all smiles
and swelling with a sense of his importance, “you
go right away to the Cartier place and tell Mrs.
Cartier that we’ve found the boys, that they’re
all right, and that we’ll be home before night.”</p>

<p>With another flash of his white teeth, ’Rastus
was off on his errand.</p>

<p>“We’d go right away,” explained Mr. Lanfranc
to Lee, “only we have a rendezvous with
another party to meet them at noon only a little
way from here. As soon as they know you’ve
been found we’ll have a bit of lunch and then we’ll
all make tracks for home. But how did it come
about that you got lost?” he continued. “I understand
you went away in the motor boat. What
became of that?”</p>

<p>“Jim Boolus stole it from us,” replied Lee.</p>

<p>“What!” cried Mr. Lanfranc.</p>

<p>He listened while Lee told him of the confession
they had extorted from the negro boy who had
acted as the tool of Boolus, and his face grew
dark with wrath, that was reflected on those of the
other members of the party.</p>

<p>“The old scoundrel!” he exclaimed. “That
caps the climax. For a long time he’s been the
bane of this parish. But up to now he’s been so
cunning that the law has had no chance to get a
grip on him. But this time he’s overreached himself,
and the minute we can lay our hands on him
we’ll clap him in jail. It will be a double satisfaction
to do that, because of the way he’s been
trying to get your mother’s property away from
her. I’m afraid he may do that yet.”</p>

<p>“No, he won’t!” cried Lee jubilantly. “We’ve
found the boundary stones of the property!”</p>

</div>

<div id='chXXX' class='chapter'>
<h2>CHAPTER XXX<br/>JIM BOOLUS TRAPPED</h2>

<p class='first'>“Say that again,” cried Mr. Lanfranc, delight
and incredulity struggling for the mastery.</p>

<p>“Sure as shooting,” affirmed Lee with a happy
laugh. “It isn’t more than an hour ago that we
came across them. Come here and I’ll show them
to you.”</p>

<p>The whole party hurried to the precious memorials
and examined them closely. The Parish
Clerk was skilled in such matters, which came
within the duties of his office, and he confirmed
the belief of the boys that these were the only
things necessary to make Mrs. Cartier’s title to
the property absolutely secure.</p>

<p>“This has been a great day,” he said, as he
rose from his knees after making notes of the
inscriptions on the stones, “not only because we
have found you boys, but because we’ve been able
to put a crimp in the plans of the greatest rascal
in this part of the parish. It was a clever
thing, by the way, that you boys caught on to the
meaning of these boundary stones.”</p>

<p>“Oh, as for that,” said Lee generously, “all
the praise must go to Bobby here. He was the
one that figured it all out.”</p>

<p>“Some boy,” said Mr. Lanfranc approvingly,
and Bobby flushed to his ears.</p>

<p>“It’s a queer coincidence,” continued Mr. Lanfranc,
“that we ran across Boolus, accompanied
by one of his negroes, in another part of the
swamp, no later than yesterday. He said that
he was out hunting, but I didn’t see that he had
any gun. But here come the other fellows,” he
added, as he caught sight of a party of three
coming into view, “and as it is pretty near noon,
I guess we’ll have our lunch right now and hurry
back home. I can imagine how impatient Mrs.
Cartier will be to have you with her as soon as
possible.”</p>

<p>The newcomers were quite as delighted as the
first party had been, to learn that the missing ones
were found and that their anxious search was
ended. They chose a spot on higher ground in
a clump of trees, and set to work on the abundant
lunch with which they were provided. The boys,
with their minds free for the first time in days,
thought it was the most delicious repast they had
ever tasted.</p>

<p>They had not quite finished when Bobby caught
sight of two figures at the edge of a fringe of
trees some distance away.</p>

<p>“Here come two other men,” he announced.</p>

<p>“Is that so?” said Mr. Lanfranc with some
curiosity. “I wonder who they are. Hunters I
suppose.”</p>

<p>“No,” cried Lee, who had been studying them
closely. “It’s Jim Boolus and that darkey of
his.”</p>

<p>“So it is,” confirmed Mr. Lanfranc, after another
look. “Lie down flat, all of you. I’m curious
to see what the old rascal is up to.”</p>

<p>They stretched themselves flat on the ground
and looked through the bushes at the approaching
couple.</p>

<p>All unconscious of the scrutiny, they came on,
Boolus in the van, his eyes scanning the ground
as they advanced.</p>

<p>Suddenly he caught sight of one of the boundary
stones, which, having been largely uncovered
during the investigation of the markings were
now in plain sight. With an exclamation of satisfaction,
he hurried toward it, and fell on his
knees to look at it closely. Then he rose to his
feet and rubbed his hands together in glee.</p>

<p>He beckoned to the colored youth, talked to him
for a minute or two and then both set to work
digging about the stone, using some implements
that the attendant had brought with him.</p>

<p>“What are they after?” asked Fred in a whisper.</p>

<p>“I know very well what they are after,” replied
Mr. Lanfranc in a low tone that held grimness
in it. “He’s hanging himself with his own
rope.”</p>

<p>The couple worked hard for perhaps a quarter
of an hour, and then with great effort dragged
the heavy stone out of its hole and laid it on the
grass. Then after resting a moment each took
one end, and half carrying, half dragging it,
moved toward the edge of a bog that lay twenty
yards away.</p>

<p>“Halt!” shouted Mr. Lanfranc, and at the
same moment the whole party rose to their feet
and poured out from among the trees.</p>

<p>At the sudden command, Boolus and his helper
dropped the stone as though they had been shot.
In a moment the members of the party were upon
them. The negro started to run, but one of the
men caught him and dragged him back by the
collar.</p>

<p>“So, Jim Boolus,” said Mr. Lanfranc, “you
robber of widows and orphans, we’ve caught you
at last. You’ve kept out of the grip of the law
for a long time, but it’s got you now. The evidence
is so clear that the jury will convict you
without leaving the box. You stole the boat of
these boys and left them to starve and die, for
all you cared—”</p>

<p>“I didn’t,” denied Boolus, “and you can’t
prove it.”</p>

<p>“This boy has confessed that he did it at your
direction,” declared Mr. Lanfranc, indicating the
negro.</p>

<p>“You don’t suppose a jury would take the word
of a negro against that of a white man, do you?”
replied Boolus, who thought he saw a ray of
hope.</p>

<p>“Against such a white man as they know you
to be, I think they would,” answered Mr. Lanfranc.
“But let that pass. Just now, all of us
have seen you commit a crime. Two minutes
more and that stone would have been swallowed
up in the bog. The removal of boundary marks
is a serious crime and a state prison offense.
You’re due for a good long time behind the bars,
Jim Boolus. Come along now,” he commanded,
cutting short abruptly the mumbling appeals
for mercy that the detected wretch was beginning.</p>

<p>The whole party took up the march, and in a
few hours reached the nearest town, where Jim
Boolus was committed to the charge of the sheriff,
who took him to the jail. There he stayed
until, a few weeks later, he began his long prison
term.</p>

<p>The boys hurried at once to the plantation,
where Lee flew to his mother’s arms. She
hugged and cried over him, as mothers do, and
then Bobby and Fred came in for a welcome
scarcely less warm. It was a glorious reunion
and one of the happiest occasions that the boys
had ever known.</p>

<p>“Do you remember what I said about a hunch
this morning?” Bobby asked Fred, when, at the
end of that jubilant day, they were getting ready
for bed.</p>

<p>“Yes,” agreed Fred, “your hunch was right.
It sure has been our lucky day!”</p>

<p>“And to think we found those boundary
stones,” put in Lee. “That’s the best ever. My
mother will want to thank you for that—when
she gets over all this excitement over our return.”</p>

<p>“Gee, but we’ll have a story to tell, when we
get back to Rockledge,” was Fred’s comment.
“Lost in a swamp, and fighting a cougar, and a
moccasin snake, and sinking in the mush—”</p>

<p>“They won’t believe the half of it,” added
Bobby. “It sure was a lot of adventures!”</p>

<p>“Well, now you’ve got to settle down to good
times on the plantation,” said Lee.</p>

<p>“I wonder if we’ll get back that motor boat,”
cried Bobby, suddenly.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” answered the Southern boy.
But it may be added that the boat had already
been found and was returned to the Cartiers the
next day.</p>

<p>Delightful days on the plantation followed.
The boys avoided the big swamp, but they visited
the cotton and the rice fields, and had the best of
times.</p>

<p>“And now, back to school!” sang out Bobby
one day, and here, getting ready to return to
Rockledge, we will leave the lads.</p>

<p class='fs12 mt10'>BOOKS BY LEO EDWARDS</p>

<p>Illustrated. Every Volume Complete in Itself.</p>

<p class='mt05'>Hundreds of thousands of boys who laughed until their sides ached over
the weird and wonderful adventures of Jerry Todd and his gang demanded
that Leo Edwards, the author, give them more books with belt-bursting
laughs and creepy shivers. So he took Poppy Ott, Jerry Todd’s
bosom chum and created the Poppy Ott series. Now there are two
more series, The Andy Blake and the Trigger Berg—and if such a thing
is possible—they are even more full of fun and excitement than the Jerry
Todds.</p>

<p class='fs12 mt10'>THE WESTY MARTIN BOOKS</p>

<p>By PERCY KEESE FITZHUGH</p>

<p>Author of the Tom Slade and Roy Blakeley Books, Etc.</p>

<p>Illustrated. Every Volume Complete in Itself.</p>

<p class='mt05'>Westy Martin, known to every friend of Roy Blakeley, appears
as the hero of these adventures. As a scout in Bridgeboro
and Temple Camp he has learned the rudiments of scoutcraft.
Now as an Eagle scout you can follow him along new trails
and among new adventures. How he became the companion
of an old trapper on a trip into the heart of the Rockies, how
he followed an old Indian trail, how he explored the vast spaces
of the old Sante Fe Trail, and later was plunged into the dramatic
events of the Mississippi flood, is told in these stories
teeming with action and thrills.</p>
